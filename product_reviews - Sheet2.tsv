Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Kusdos !!	2017-06-19	India	100	   Used it after cleaned chains with c1 chain clean and it's must. Use this only after you remove dirt from chains. Because this is like a sticky covering lube. Don't ride after applying lube. Leave it for 5-7 hrs to reach every part of chain. Better use hand to rotate tyre and apply. Never use it in 1st gear vehicle on mode.As it is sticky Lube, Best in Rainy season. Using it for my RE Classic 350. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Disappointed got a broken peice with leakage and no return policy	2018-07-09	India	67	   The cap was broken and it was sticky all inside the packageThe product is not returnable 😐1st time heart "breaking" service by Amazon 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Best chain lube!	2019-04-15	India	30	   I have been using Motul Chain Lube for 6 years. I have tried various brands and I always get back to Motul.Tip: For best results, first use a chain cleaner (you can use motul cleaner, diesel, WD40, etc.). Then use a grunge brush to thoroughly clean the grime off the chain. Spray water and clean with a cloth to remove all dirt/grease. Now, do not straight away spray the chain lube! This is why many people complain that the lube does not work properly. You need to warm up the chain a bit. Ride 200~300 mts before lubing. If you can manage to do it carefully, you can even shift to first gear while on center stand or paddock, and wait for a while. After this, apply the lube. Since it was warmed up, it sticks in a better manner. You need to primarily spray on the 'O Rings', and not on the sides of the chain. Once applied, wipe off the excess on the sides, and ride for a while so that it evenly settles.Pros:1. My favorite feature of Motul lube is the quality of the spraycan and also the provision of two different type of applicators. I use both the short and long applicators extensively.2. If you know how chain lubes work, and where to apply it, you need to apply very little. I am happy that applying two coats lasts upto 400kms for me under normal conditions. I have seen people spray the lube all over the chain, and complain saying it's too sticky, or that they need to use a lot. The lube is primarily for the 'O Rings' only. If you spray too much on the sides, dirt particles will also end up sticking to the chain.3. The lube is very sticky. This is how it should be! It sticks well to the O Rings and doesn't lose its strength even after multiple washes (provided you don't use a power wash on it).Cons:1. I wish the quantity provided was more.>> Product recommended. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Original product with neat packing	2017-07-03	India	37	   I got it in a deal for 362. Regarding product, its orginal and new one (i recieved april 2017 batch). Pakaging was ok. Because they just packed in a carton no bubble wrap. May be because of these some guys received leaked bottle. In my case it was intact. Product is good enough for motorcycle with less than 80bhp. Supersport may need professional type lubes. Easily last 500km if you apply it after a good cleaning and give time to penetrate lube. So one 400ml bottle is enough for atleast 10k kms to 15k kms. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Don't get deceived by the positive reviews	2018-09-28	India	13	   The product such a slicker. In the beginning, you'll find that you are saving a lot of money just by cleaning and oiling with MOTUL spray. The aftermath is unexpected. The chain ages very faster. You need to change the chain and sprockets within 2 years itself. The slowly loses its ability to sustain the lubrication and ends its life.I'm one of the victims. I have used the 3M lubricant also. Even that is also not good.The best option is to lubricate the chain is to apply the grease after cleaning with Kerosene or Diesel. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Convenience over Gear Oil (though Gear oil does the same job much cheaply)	2018-10-25	India	10	   Nice product. Have been using to lubricate my bike's sealed O-Ring chain every 400 kms or so, after cleaning it with diesel. The product provides lubrication just like SAE -90/ EP-90 gear oil (some use SAE/EP-120 grade too) but scores over it in the following areas-  Ease of transportation/ carriage , especially on long rides. The package, being pressurised and in a can , can be transported with ease-  Lesser residue on the wheels thrown out by a moving chain.  The Gear Oil, though a lot cheaper and giving the same amount of lubrication, tends to soil the wheels.All in All a good product, though somewhat costly. I picked it up for its ease of carriage. When I'm touring, it's handy. All other times SAE -90 or SAE 120 gear oil does the duty perfectly . Here's a link of the same product at Amazonhttps://www.amazon.in/HP-Lubricants-Gear-Drive-EP-140/dp/B01M7PBFT0/ref=sr_1_11?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1540443880&sr=1-11&keywords=gear+oiland thishttps://www.amazon.in/HP-Lubricants-Gear-Drive-EP-140/dp/B01M7PBFT0/ref=sr_1_11?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1540443880&sr=1-11&keywords=gear+oil 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Bad Experience	2019-03-02	India	5	   Firstly I wanted to say MOTUL is a brand product.There is no doubt that the quality of the product will be cheap but just I wanted to share my experience after purchase of this product almost after 2 months I have opened it to use to lube my bike chain when I use that I found that there was a leakage all the liquid came out while spraying not from the nozzle but it was a leakage from somewhere else I think somewhere someone is cheating or Amazon not checking properly there quality checkers are not doing their work properly there should be some law if a customer faces this kind of tissue should be resolved while buying this product there was a detail not detail but not some note was mentioned that this product is non returnable but what if customer getting a damaged product what customer will do because he has already paid for it and getting the defective product. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Perfect product for chain lunging.	2019-04-27	India	4	   I own a Dominar 400, used to take to showroom for chain spray wvwry time. They use OKS brand chain spray in Bajaj Showroom, Its available in Amazon too foe the same cost but comes a bit large (100ml more). I had plans of getting OKS at first but it was out of stock LUCKILY and I ended up buying Motul C2 insted. Guess what! My bike used to vibrate at 80-95km/hr speed. Its gone... Mann!! I wish I could have realised its my chain that was the reson for vibration. BIG THUMS UP. Follow me on YouTube : SWAGAT VLOGS ;) Iwill take you places you never have been before 😉 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Nice product but bit sticky in comparison to similar products from competition	2018-03-17	India	8	   Motul being well known brand needless to say its a good product. HAve used this on RE Bullet 500, have found it bit sticky if compared with 3M chain lube and RE's chain lube. Currently using RE chain lube as it is not that sticky thereby dust accumulation on the chain is less. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Excellent product. Sufficient quantity for the price	2017-01-02	India	7	   Excellent product. Sufficient quantity for the price. But remeber to purchase chain cleaner atlest 400 ml not 150 ml because 150 ml is insufficient according to me. If you find rim to be sticky because of this lubricant purchase Dazlo universal cleaner from Amazon itself. Its soap based liquid cleans the sticky lubricant on rim effectively. Happy shopping and happy biking everyone. Atlast thank you Amazon and Motul. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Pathetic Delivery Packaging. The can arrived broken. The sprayer was damaged. Can't even spray.	2017-10-25	India	8	   The product is good and does what it is supposed to do perfectly.However, Amazon's packaging this time was terrible. The spray can's cap was open and the sprayer was damaged. Can't use the sprayer. Also a lot of liquid spill inside the packet itself. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Thank you Motul for making our lives easier	2019-06-08	India	One	   First I bought the 90 gear oil to lube my chain after watching a youtube video. Thought it was a cheap alternative. But boy I was wrong. It might be better in some aspects, it will certainly ruin the beauty of your bike. It requires a lot more labor. As soon as you put the gear oil on the chain, it will start dripping on the floor. And as soon as you ride your bike, it will soil you wheel, chain cover, under body parts. I immediately regretted using it.I just used it once and bought the Motul chain lube. Now I just need to spray it on the chain (which takes maybe 5 mins) and I can take the bike for a ride without the tension of it spilling everywhere. This lube is sticky and sticks to the chain very fast. It won't spill anywhere. I applied on my chain at 1350kms and it worked till the next time at 1991kms. For me this lube is perfect as it is too much time saving and cleaner than the gear oil method. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Good	2018-09-16	India	4	   This is my second purchase of motul chain lube.On my first purchase that seller sell the lube without long spray nozzle.But this time i got the long spray nozzle as well.Thanks to the seller cloudtail India.I am a great fan of you Cloudtail. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Not a pressure cannister, no return accepted, loss of money	2018-07-27	India	5	   Second worst product which i have got from amazon.chain lube should be a pressurised cannister but this is not . every time i have to shake to make pressure and it doesnot last for more than 2 spray and all above this these people doesnot accept return . So ultimately i have lost my money.so please be carefull while buying products from motul/amazon 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	8 month user  review	2018-02-27	India	5	   I use this product from my Bajaj dominar for every 500 km I must say when comparing it with normal lubricants it provides a much more smoother interaction for the chain  and I recommended for other bikes too.As it will increase the longevity of your bikes chain 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Expensive but great quality!	2019-05-31	India		   Motul is known for its quality. This chain lube speaks volumes of that quality. Once applied, it really helps to keep chain noise to a minimum, and reduces friction so that wheel rotation is at its smoothest.However, it tends to lose its properties after passing the 700km mark in dry weather, or about 250km if continuously riding in monsoon season. Overall a great product and it serves the purpose well.You can go for SAE 90 grade gear oil for lubrication too which costs 1/10th price of this lube but is messy to clean up when lubricating the next time. This leaves little to no residue, just dries up on continuous usage. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	This is a good product.	2019-01-05	India	One	   This too is a good product as the C1, except one thing that I found which was irritating; after I apply it on the chain, during the run, the stuff when gets stuck on the rims, it is difficult to remove it normally by either washing with washing powder or by shampoo. I am figuring out some other option for cleaning the rim.What I used to do was, I cleaned the chain with kerosene, dried it with a clean cloth, I had to carryout the cleaning process 2-3 times but by C1 it is in one go. After cleaning the chain and drying it with a clean cloth I used to apply 2T oil on it for lubrication; C2 instead scores good over 2T oil.Now with C2 chain lub the lubrication is quite effective as it sticks to the chain and secondly penetrates till the depth giving it a great life for more duration.Above all it is a great product, lubricates the chain very well. maybe that I had applied excess quantity of C2!! 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Required for Open chain Bikes	2019-07-18	India		   Pros:1. I see +3~4 kms increase in mileage on Royal Enfield 350 cc in city limits for first 500 kms post chain lube.2. Does not attract much dirt and keeps the chain well lubricated - I definitely see and feel the difference.Cons:1. Pricey, the price difference from site to site varies and fluctuates on Amazon itself, i initially ordered for a premium I ended up cancelling as there was a price drop the very next day.2. applying lube on the wheel facing side of the chain is a bit tricky the nozzle extn provided should be 'u' shaped rather than being straight. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Long lasting and deep penetrating protection.	2019-02-21	India	2	   Nothing beats the quality of Motul when it comes to lubrication.➡️This spray lasts for 500 kilometers once you to spray it generously. 😉➡️It improves the overall ride quality of your motorcycle. Results in less vibrations & smooth shifting ⚙️⚠️ The only thing that disappoint me is the amount of liquid at the price point. I wish it came a little cheaper. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Fairly priced and lasts long enough!	2020-03-06	India	One	   After reading many reviews complaining they got broken nozzle, I decided to order it along with other items from Cloudtail itself and mine came in one shape. Was delivered in 2 days.The spray is a thin liquid and doesn't need much pressing on the nozzle for it to come out. Stick well to the chain and lasts around 420 to 440 kms easily. Tip is to clean and dry the chain with a microfiber and leave it for half hour. Then apply this lubricant from all sides. Then leave the bike for an hour before using. 9/10 would recommend. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Damaged/Used product delivered	2020-07-27	India		   Seems the product is damaged or already used several times.Cap had lot of sticky fluids on it due to that very difficult to open the cap itself.The detachable nozel pipe given for sharp and exact application of the lube was also damaged 😑Would have certainly returned this particular shipment, if the same was allowed. Now it is really going to be very difficult to spary on the desired part (chain) without spilling it on spokes, tyre, silencer etc.Brand is really good as I have used it earlier too, but this particular shipment deserves bad rating from my side 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Motul is the way	2019-05-06	India	One	   after using motul engine oil i have become fan of motul... i used many of the chain lubes in market... TVS and some other brands whose  name i dont remember... They all leave a spatter on rims after use..but didnt notice that with motul... and  it lasts longer toooother brands get washed off when u wash ur bike or in rain.. but motul chain lube sticks on 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	nice product.	2017-05-25	India	8	   nice product.. i request all sellers to add a glue tape around the cap and the tin to hold the cap and tin together. so that it prevents leakage and cap displacement 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Go for it and how to use	2017-08-03	India	5	   Go for it without thinking, Procedure:- remove the dirt from chain using diesel or engine oil, and clean it properly apply the lube and dont ride the bike immidiately, keep it over night you will see  it will get sticky and thats good. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Always lube your chain!	2019-12-10	India		   I own a KTM Duke 250 and I make sure to lube my chain every 500 odd kilometers as its essential to maintain a smooth ride and also give full service life to the chain and sprocket. It's easy to use... I own a paddock stand. One protip... Lube the chain in the night before your ride for best results.Small size is easy to carry in my backpack and it lasts long. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Superb product	2017-11-09	India	3	   Already wrote a review for cleaner.. definitely recommended..Personal suggestion for anyone with a bike with open chain go for 3M or Motul..don't take chance with other local ones.Price I am not sure if it's correct pricing or low or high.. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Leaked product delivered...Very disappointed.	2018-07-06	India	4	   Producy was already open when delivered and lot of oil had already come out..To make things worse this product does not qualify for return. What am i supposed to do now ??? 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Working perfectly.	2019-07-18	India	One	   Some years ago, i used greese and normal engine oil to lube my bike chain.One of my friend recommend this oil. This oil has outstanding performance.Please clean your chain with kerosene, apply it after 30mins and no need to buy a chain brush. Pick any used tooth brush from bathroom and use it.For better performance everyone should lube the chain after 60-100 days interval and cleaning in 120-200 days . (It depends upon where you ride, full off-road riding recommend cleaning in 90 days.) 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Cheap & best in spray Chain lube	2019-01-28	India		   All open chain bikes required frequent lubricationAnd spry-lube like Motul is the perfect solution.I own an 2011 model R15 and using this Motul spray-lube since 7 Years I have started maintaining my bike myself.Can with stand/Hold in to chain and sprockets for up to 500~700 km or 2~3 months easily.Never spill out to surrounding parts or drips when you stop your bike.--Has good adhesiveness too 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Poor packaging	2017-08-27	India	8	   Motul products are very good and I have no problem with quality.. But the packaging was very poor bcz of which the cap was broken and there was leakage everywhere inside package... I'm rating this in terms of packaging only... 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	DAMAGED PRODUCT	2018-05-31	India	3	   Received product yesterday. When i opened it, my hands got sticky. Oil was spread everywhere.Packaging was very poor, the cap of bottle was not on its position. I think i hav received used product or damaged product. The host should provide attention on packaging part.really disappointed. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Perfect Lubricant for Bike Chain	2018-08-11	India	One	   Happy with the product. Does what it is meant for. Perfect for Bike chains, channel gates, Door hinges. Perfect lubricant. Smooth operation after using this Motul C2 chain lubricant.Note for the seller:Use bubble wrap for all the liquid products, It had a big dent outside. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	3	Good product, but you can get better	2019-08-16	India		   Better than any other options in market. But it will make lots of stain on the rim. Eventually those sticky stains will catch dust from road. So there will be an extra job for you to clean your rim with kerosene or petrol or wd40. It will remain for atleast 500-600 km in Indian city condition. But I will recommend to use Glosil chain lube, as I found it is excellent in terms of other competition.*I have used both products along with other products available in market. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Good product. But expensive	2020-06-05	India		   This is the best product in the market.The only downside to this is that it is messy and will stick to your rim after a prwsh coat.Motul chain paste is easier to apply and is a lot less messier if compared to chain lube.It is a bit expensive too, but price to performance is quite good. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Awesome	2020-07-05	India		   It's good FR Rainy season water from bike can b used on nuts b bolts tooDo not spray on disc brake but u can spray on callipers.After spraying do not ride the bike for atleast 8hrs. Liquid has to be absorbed on the chain.Use in dry weather conditions. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Does its job perfectly.....	2019-01-17	India		   This time amazon delivered it before time, I am quite happy with this and the best part this is made in Thailand and sep 18 product, not so old. This is for the third time, I had ordered this motul c2 &  it does its job perfectly, it has some gum based properties which sticks to the chain, what I suggest is clean your bikes chain first & just spray and let it settle for almost half an hour & then  only take your bike for a spin and you will notice the smoothness... 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Must have for sports bike users..	2018-01-28	India	One	   Recommend to use chain lubrication after every 500 kms run. I’ve been using this for last 2 years. This lubricant keeps chain lubricated nearly 500 kms as it is claimed, depending on season. In rainy season you may need to use more times.You may also need rare wheel swing-arm. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Motul c2	2018-11-09	India		   I cannot say wether this is the best chain lube out there or not as i have used chain lube for the first time itself and this is my first chain lube. Used it on my bike (apache rtr 200)  and my cycle (firefox) the performance on both is super. Smooth rollin of chain no noise at all and lube sticks to the chain n lubs it well and remains on the chain for a longer time. Attracts less dirt and works well in rainy season also. Thumbs up for this product. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Best and the most affordable chain maintainance kit	2020-05-29	India		   It's value for money and keeps the chain wet. I've been using it since 5 years and never had any complain. Use Chain clean and leave it for 10 - 15 minutes for optimum infusion. Clean it with an old brush and spray again. All the dirt will drop like a dead old man. Clean the chain with a cloth. Spray the lube evenly and don't go on spraying as it will drip or will fly after you ride the bike. Do not ride the bike for atleast 4 hours after application. Stay wet & ride safe! 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	3	Ok to use but think before you buy quantity is very less	2019-10-29	India		   Good to use but doesn't stay for long every week we need to apply it for chain or once in two weeks have to be chain lubricated. Very less quantity it will get over very soon. Price also little high if it is not in deal of the day. Better to use engine oils or used engine oil which we get from garage 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	3	Good product with bad packaging by Amazon	2020-02-25	India		   Have been using this product for more than a year. Re-ordered the product again and got a can with broken cap. Use the product on the chain after riding for at least 5 minutes so that the chain gets hot/warm for better functioning of the lubricant. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Lubricates	2019-08-10	India		   This a well known brand lubricant. It works as described. Just put the bike on main stand and run it in first gear. Then spray the can with a steady hand on the bike chain. Use it after cleaning the chain with cleaner. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Can be applied easily..	2019-12-07	India		   This can be applied to the chain easily without putting any effort. But before applying make sure you cover the the side part of chain with some type of cloth material or a paper. Overall it's worth of price.. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Useful while traveling	2019-05-10	India		   This chain spray can is very useful if are on a ride and can't get chain sparay in every 1000 kms.It lasts for 500-1000 kms only though while using in city traffic daily I don't really recommend this spray.I use gear oil mostly.High grade and lasts for long. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	2	Dissapointed	2019-10-01	India		   I used it for my Bajaj pulsar AS150...for my surprise the chain got rusted with in a week..don't know what's the reason for it, after all I bought it after seeing the reviews on Amazon..I truly disliked this product..instead iam using lube from Bajaj company and it is doing good. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Lube that lasts 2000 km	2019-06-23	India	One	   Once lubed the chain will run for around 2000 km in Summer and 500-600 in Rainy season. Containing one short and one long nozzles, comfortable while applying the lube. Remember to clean the chain and spocket properly pre using this product. Do not apply on dirty chain. The only drawback is that it attract dusts very quickly and you might have to clean your spocket housing (Towards Engine Side) every 5000 km. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	The packing was poor but it doesnt matter	2018-06-12	India		   I have been using Motul lube more past one year for my bike. It is a worthy buy as you can feel the difference after applying the oil. The gear shift and running becomes smooth. The packing was poor but it doesnt matter, the product is leak proof. It was delivered on time as well. Thanks to Cloudtail and Amazon 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Better solution to extend your chain spokets life	2019-09-11	India		   Dear Guys,  this is so useful item for our bikes. Because if you goto any local workshop to spray once, he will charge 50. I had a combined purchase order with polish. The delivery was fast and nothing much to review about such product. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Must for Bikers....	2019-09-06	India		   Motul is little expensive but the best in class..Bikes above 200 cc should be lubes every 500km..So that chain and mileage will be good..Package and delivery was good..And remember guys...this is a non returnable product.. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Good value-for-money chain lube	2019-04-09	India		   It's a good chain lube oil considering the brand and efficiency of the product. Best suited when coupled with the Chain cleaner, however, if you don't have the cleaner, you can take a damp cloth and wipe the chain to clean it - if you don't have a pressure pipe to clean. Start the engine, keep the gear box in neutral and bike on double stand and you can easily spray through the entire chain multiple times for best results.I personally don't get the lubing done in regular service in Yamaha showrooms, as I find it to be unnecessarily costly. For the same money you can easily lube your chain 8-10 times or more from this Motul chain lube.The only con I found out was the bubble wrap, it was a different bubble wrap and I wasn't able to play around bursting it. 😂 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Good product	2019-04-30	India		   It's really good product. Feels like filtered grease with less sticky. It reduces the black carbon particles getting accumulated in chain. But the grease doesn't stay for long. Especially during rainy season.Also after using Kangaroo for a long time felt Motul is the best. Kangaroo becomes too greasy after a single use. And when you try to clean u feel see like tar accumulated in chain. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Good and recommend..	2019-12-05	India		   Good product with long lasting lubrication to chain.This lube has a sticky substance mixed which stick to your chain for long time to give u a better performance.Though it is sticky but still I didnt attract dust..

If you really want to take care of your chain, I hear Dinolube is the best in the business. And I would like for this motul product to be a little cheaper as well.

You should mandatorily buy c1  chain clean or kerosene (WD40) TO REMOVE that. Else this is a good product.

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Good Product for Bike-Lovers !	2017-01-12	India	13	   Got this product for my hubby. And the moment I handed it over to him, he very enthusiastically ran to his bike (Avenger Cruise 220) and he was so excited that he didn't even read the instructions properly. He just cleaned the chain casually with a "Self-Made Chain Cleaner" 😁😁😁 (made with old toothbrushes and which I don't think is capable to clean the bike chain thoroughly) and then he sprayed this Chain Lube quite adequately.When he read the instructions afterwards, his face was worth seeing as he became very concerned about the chain. 😁Anyway, it's a very good quality product. One additional spray-cap with long nozzle is provided with the can. Yet to see the difference it makes in the chain's performance but  The only thing I surely want to suggest is, Please don't spray it over the chain without cleaning the chain thoroughly first. I think it's better to use it after you get your bike serviced.Overall, a nice product for bike-lovers ! 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Got an open bottle	2017-07-27	India	7	   So its a good chain lube, i have already ordered many things from cloudtail, thing what i didnt like was i got open pack, the bottle was quaterly used, it was already opened packed so nozzle got pressed while delivery as we, the long pipe was missing, disappointed. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Good Chain Lubricant.	2017-05-06	India	One	   Packaging was perfect. It was wrapped with bubble wrap and put inside a box.My Review:I've used 3M before.Now, I got this and after using this one, I didn't realize any difference.Just the difference is, this one comes with small straw and 3M comes with long straw.I sprayed 4 times with 3M. I feel this one will last 3 times.This one is costlier than 3M. I'll buy 3M from next time on wards.Overall, the product is great, no issues so far. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Thoughtfully designed. Good performance.	2016-10-23	India	One	   Apply as per instructions. Works as desired. Does not gather dust like other products ans grease. Also survives some washes. Best one for chains so far.One good thing is that it comes with twoSpray heads. One with a long delivery pipe and other attached by default that has a short spray head. In case you loose one, you have a backup right there in the can. Quite thoughtful!. I had to throw or buy same cans in the past just because i lost the delivery pipes. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	3	Worst packaging ever	2016-03-22	India	One	   Nothing against the product, it is awesome.. I have used it before.  Lasts for  an year if you use it after every 400 kms or so.The downside here is the packaging, mine came with open cap and the lube was all over the bottle and the cap so it was very sticky and it got all over my hands while unboxing. If you're selling a premium product, atleast provide decent packaging. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Amazing chain lube	2016-07-21	India	4	   Amazing chain lube , as i am a motul guy ,i am using this product since from 3years and it does its job perfectly .Its really too sticky .used it on my YAMAHA R15 (my baby) which works very perfect and smooth .highly recommend to all the  guys looking to buy chain lube  ....Coming to product delivery status , really it was miracle ,i placed order on 16th and received it on 17th (just within one day I received my package) thanks to Amazon...:-) 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Bad packaging	2017-03-14	India	One	   Received it with the cap open and leaking all over inside the package. It was on the can and got on my hands also. I dunno what kind of a retard packs a lube without securing the cap. Dogs are smarter than the ass who packed this. This stuff is very hard to get off the hands. Its very sticky as well.The product in itself is a good product, but crappy to use while getting ur hands sticky every time. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Must go for bike lovers	2017-10-01	India	3	   I was in a dual mind before ordering the product as I have never had a chain lube of my own before this and used to use only stock brand suggested one. All this changed the moment I cleaned my chain and sprayed it with Motul C2 chain lube. It felt great after the application to ride the machine. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	This lubricant is simply amazing. I have not used any other product so ...	2015-06-09	India	4	   You got to clean the chain off dust, dirt, water etc. Use Motul Chain clean product.This lubricant is simply amazing. I have not used any other product so really can not compare. But you will feel the difference after using it. Go ahead and buy this if you want to keep your bike chain lasting long. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Worth every penny!	2016-05-17	India	6	   Very sticky lube and remains intact even in rainy days. Make sure to clean the chain well before applying lube. Used diesel for cleaning my R15 o-ring chain, left 3 hours to dry. Applied lube and left whole night.  Previously used Rolon,Glosil, OKS but all splashed on my rear wheel. Super sticky Motul never did.

Reduces chain noise while running5.Doesnt leave the carbon residue hence, chain will be clean.6.it Lubricates well7.its Motul 😀I use it for my RC390 in (India😘) 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	One of the best lube.	2016-08-29	India	One	   Nice product and one of the best available  in the market both national and international . Price is ok in comparison to other product of the same category with brand name.  But with a bit of discount  from Amazon, it would be a great product no doubt. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Good	2017-05-21	India	5	   Good. Clean chain with lil soft cotton cloth dipped in kerosene and toothbrush and let it dry, then apply this lube and let it set. No more squeaky chain sounds 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Best chain lube you can get.	2017-05-04	India		   Never used a chain lube in my 6 years of biking but then i decided to give it a try. Company was putting waste engine oil to lube the chain earlier. So got some diesel and cleaned up the chain and applied this motul chain cleaner. Now there is no going back for me. My karizma has stopped making any sound from chain. It works so silently. I was like blown away with the silence of the chain. Will definitely try motul engine oil now to see if i could make my bike as silent as it gets. Loved the product and if you are thinking about buying it just go for it. I have not tried any other chain brands like 3M or others but nor i am going to pretty satisfied with this one no need to go out and search for any other. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Must read the below before buying	2018-09-07	India	One	   This product does it job but but it is a very sticky substance,just like tree gum or rasin.Must be used only when u knew how to clean a chain(with use of petrol&Moil by brush).So I think you should avoid this product if you are regular rider.It is tooo sticky for normal guys.Before every use of this product you must clean chain otherwise this will destroy every single part of your chain set.This is for very very professional and experienced riders only.New riders kindly stay away from this.This is gem for professionals but coal for non professionals. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Price issue little bit	2018-02-13	India	One	   Product is good I am writing review after use it and product is good and I am using in TVS APACHE RAR 160 After 400 and 500 km ride before this u can tight ur chain and clean it then spray it if we talk about TVS services center the charge 50 rs for this service...... One thing product is outside from India then why price is always fluctuat its no to good for customer..... Before u purchase check price schedule.... 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Great product inappropriate packing with no plastic pipe	2016-06-14	India	3	   The product is great no doubt. Mine came in yesterday after but to my dismay without an extended plastic pipe which can help you reach to the difficult areas where can spray the lube. Its a shame. Kindly send the missing plastic pipe. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Awesome Lube, Long Lasting	2017-08-30	India	One	   Well only thing I have to say is "WELL DONE MOTUL".Lube is SUPERB and works well on the chain. I ride electra, it is important to keep the chain lubricated during monsoons . Motul works really well as it is sticky and stays for longer duration after application.I am writing this review after using the product for 2 months.Well Done Motul 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Must buy for KTM owners.	2016-09-14	India	One	   The product is very useful.Got it for my KTM RC200. The ride feels smoother after having used the lube, the chain looks cleaner (it was a little rusty and scuffed earlier).There is a noticeable difference in ride quality after application.I use it once every 700-1000 kms or 10 days (whichever is earlier).If your bike gets drenched in rain or you ride through water, its recommended to re-apply the lubricant over the chain.I am very satisfied with the product. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	2	Its pathetic for open chain bikes	2016-12-16	India	3	   This product is suitable for covered chain bikes. Its pathetic for open chain bikes. As the lube is very dense it attracts a lot of dust and dirt which makes a thick mixture of them. It gets diffcult to be cleaned easily. I have used it for my RE TB350. Not recommended for it. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Tested on Thunderbird 350	2016-02-16	India	One	   Tried cleaning the chain of my Thunderbird 350 with Motul Chain Clean. Just sprayed it on and left for 15 minutes for the sludge to become loose. Used a toothbrush to remove tough stains, followed by a wipe using microfibre cloth.  Sprayed on the Chain lube. The chain is spanking new :) 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Great	2017-05-17	India	5	   use it on my RE 350 also got the Chain Cleaner with brush work well Recommend it for RE's Enjoy Thumping 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Trusted Lube	2017-07-28	India		   I have finished one can before this one, this is to replenish my stock of this trusted lube. I clean my chain with diesel every 5000kms. rest just keep applying lube when the rings seem dry. The 400ml can is good value. Other lubes are pretty much similar cost per ML since it is SAE oil which costs the same to obtain for everyone, the packing size may be different. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	its a saviour	2017-08-23	India	One	   Recommend  this for that every biker who wants to save on the oiling the chain at the service station cuz those guys at the service station take 150-200 rs per service and this entire bottle lasts you good 6-8 times or more if used well. Do get a chain cleaner spray with this to clean the chain before applying the lube. You can also use kerosine or WD 40 instead to clean your chains. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Lubricated the chain exceptionally well	2018-06-20	India	2	   In my local shop and also in Amazon the price of this product is twice as that of other local brands, hence First I bought the other brand and tried it and the result was not satisfacory. So last week I ordered this from amazon and just sprayed it over the chain by rotating the tire manually by hand. The following day when I rode my bike to work the bike was butter smooth and almost like the chain was new. Hence handling has also become better.Additionally I also sprayed it on a jammed dead bolt at my window and now that also moves up and down very smoothly.This will become very useful when we just have to lubricate the chain in between the services. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Great value for money	2016-11-07	India	One	   To good lubrication but very sticky. Be careful while applying. If it touches Discs or Hand, it is an effort to remove that.I am extremely happy with lubrication and stickiness properties which is really important for a good chain lubricant. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	... used this product earlier also and this is the best product for my motorcycle (avenger220)	2017-05-05	India	3	   i have used this product earlier also and this is the best product for my motorcycle (avenger220).i am cutting off 1 star because i didnt get the long straw just like what others are also saying. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	3	A must for RE	2017-11-08	India	2	   After I bought my Bike,I used it without applying any Chain Lube for 8 months. Then one day the chain sprocket was damaged and I lost almost 4000 to replace it. When I replaced it, the first thing I did was ordering a chain lube. Its been 10 months since I started using it, and there has been no issues.Don't make my mistake just buy it and use it once a month.I'm giving only 3 Star because, I didn't receive any Nozzle in the package. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Terrible experience	2018-04-14	India		   Absolute rubbish experience buying this product. Firstly I'm a noob cyclist so I wasn't aware of the best kind of lube for my chain. Went ahead and purchased this one. But before I could use it I decided to call Motul customer care and all them whether this product is appropriate for a cycle chain. That guy very confidently said that it works on all kinds of chains including cycle chains. Somehow I still want very convinced and decided to return the product but Amazon doesn't accept returns on inflammable products for safety reasons. What a rubbish reasoning; if it's so right to transport these products how come you can't transport it back?Anyway, I went ahead and used it, it made my chain a gooey mess. It is extremely sticky and will make your cycling twice as tough. Cyclists should certainly not buy this product, but I'm guessing such a sticky product can't be too good for your motorcycle chain either because it collects far too much dirt off the roads. That dirt and grit-stones will wear your chain and drivetrain down. 3M is a lot better for motorcycle chains. For cycles please go ahead and buy a cycle specific chain lube. There's this brand called looplube that seeks on Amazon at pretty reasonable rates. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	very Good product but highly priced	2016-01-20	India	One	   I Own a Karizma I used Motul C2 to lube the chain, prior to lube I used C1 to clean. This a very good product. The lube doesn't wash away during wet condition and resists dust to an extent unlike the traditional grease or oil method. I give it a  4 star because the price is too high for the quantity 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Smooth ride guaranteed	2016-03-27	India	2	   Recommended to use chain lubrication after 1000km. This is the one of the best in the market, so you can blindly go for this. You won't regret after buying this product. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Awesome	2016-03-10	India		   As usual the best lube for the smoothest operation. However due to it's low viscosity it get's dried up a little sooner than others(not a problem for me as I love lubing the chain) 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Nice product and bit cost effective	2016-10-14	India	2	   Nice product and bit cost effective, my bikes started working as Normal without any noise, bike running condition is also very smooth. Value for Money. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Excellent product	2017-11-16	India	One	   Excellent product for chain lubrication in combination with motul chain clean. But causes quite a bit of fling off.  economic only for high end bikes with costly chains. Because a normal bike chain sprocket set itself costs between 800-2000. So not worth it to use a lube combo worth 1000. Use only engine oil and kerosene for normal bike chains.

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Best out there considering price to performance.	2017-04-05	India	2	   Hi, this one is definitely better than the 3M chain lube, it has better retaining properties and is more viscous than the others, go for it 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Awesome Lube	2017-09-30	India	One	   I used it for the first time in my bike, CBF Stunner. Just followed the instructions from a YouTube channel for cleaning the chain. After I applied the lube, the noise has reduced drastically also I felt such a smooth in riding as well as the gear shifting is very smooth now. Really recommend for anyone who have lot of vibration and noise issues with their. You'll definitely feel the difference. Thanks Motul! For this brilliant product. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	3	Need water proofing..	2017-09-18	India		   This was claimed that this chain lube does not attract dust/durt from roads. Let me tell you, it does attract but less. And the worst part of this quality is that it easily gets washed away easily in rain. Next research should be done to make it water proof as well which will increase its life. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Brilliant actually!	2016-04-11	India	One	   Brilliant actually !!! serves the purpose !! your your a person who takes care of your bike, go for it !!! i bought it from "Cloudtail" for 530 bucks !!

The issue is with me that I received a leaking spray nozzle and half of the lube is already sprayed inside the packaging. Amazon please give more protection with this kind of stuff(aerosol). Long pipe is also missing in the package which was shown in the product images

After you use this, your rims and silencer will be covered with black spots due it's sticky nature. It is really tough to remove those black spots. You will have to use a release agent to remove the black spots.

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Extremely good quality product,I bought two pieces twice.Totally I bought 4 pieces.I can't comment in words,You must use this	2016-05-18	India	7	   Motul C2 Road Chain Lube is suited for Non O-Ring, O-Ring, X-Ring or Z-Ring Chains. Works as a degreaser to remove gunk and road grim from chains. Use motul chain lube after use of chain clean.Used this after cleaning my chain with the motul chain cleaner (also awsome!) This stuff sticks to the chain perfectly leaving an invisible but solid protection for your chain. Really happy with this chain lubeI've gone through two cans of this stuff, I'm always trying different chain lube. This is my favorite but if you ride any dirt roads I wouldn't recommend it because sand really sticks to it.White chain lubricant formulated for racing chains. Based on solid additives for anti-wear during extreme speeds and pressures. Reduces friction and wear that leads to power losses. Resists water and protects from corrosion that increases the chain lifespan. Compatible with O-ring, X-ring and Z-ring chains.This stuff is supposed to stay on your chain because it's very sticky but for me it still flings off at high speed and its very sticky and very hard to clean off of your bike. It has the consistency of elmers glue. Also if you mis-spray a little, which happens every once in while, it will be hard to get off of the bike too. Also because it's white you see it all over the bike and after some riding it becomes black and tar-like and once again hard to clean. I prefer a more liquid-like lube. Just my preference, obviously a lot of people like it but I don't.It's a recommended product for all Bikes

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Expensive, but worth it.	2016-07-11	India	7	   Bought this 3 months ago for 530 rupees, yes expensive compared to similar products, but then again it's a Motul's product. Now coming to the product, the lube is quite good and doesn't fling if applied with properly. Lasts for about 400kms considering that you spray the adequate amount. Quite sticky, so be careful while applying so that it doesn't get sprayed on tyres or rims. Has to be used after cleaning the chain first. If budget isn't a constraint, get this product as it may be the best chain lube out there. Just my opinion.Look for tutorials on Youtube on how to use the product efficiently.

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Buy the combo unit during deal, detailed review.	2018-04-10	India	5	   This is my second set of the motul chain lube and chain cleaner spray. Got first one at 990 but got best deal at 495 for second set. The brand speaks for itself. Both the products are really good.Procedure :1. Heat up the chain by riding the bike for some time.2. Spray Motul Chain clean C1 on the chain. Make sure you spray it on the side where it is connected to the sprocket, basically the inner side of the chain because that is the part in contact with sprocket. After spraying cleaning liquid, run the bike on mainstand for a few minutes.3. You can use chain cleaning brush to remove the dirt n grease. I would recommend using a piece of cloth as well to cleanly rub off the dirt.4. Next spray Motul Chain lube C2. Again spray this on the inner side of chain. Make sure you spray the required amount, spraying excess would attract dirt in future. I would recommend you do this and leave the bike overnight so that the lube penetrates well.5. Wipe off excess lube with a piece of clothPS- I would recommend it every 500kms 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	1	Too Much sticky , like honey	2016-05-13	India	5	   It is too much sticky , increases the rolling resistance of chain. I can feel vibration in my bike due to chain become sticky after applying it.It may be work for Normal chain but as mine chain is O ring type that all ready have much rolling resistance.I have to remove my chain and soak it in diesel over night to remove this spray and now vibration are gone.if you do not believe me than just spray a very small amount of it in you hand and see after 2 minutes that how much stick it is.Not recommend , The best chain lube i have used is YAMALUBE off rode chain lube, but i am unable to find it now.

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	A very nice chain lubricant which performs well.	2015-10-06	India	9	   Lubes the chain well. My bike certainly felt a lot smoother every time I lubed the chain. Holds it's own for about 500kms, haven't tested beyond that. It's a spray based lubricant so you need to spray carefully in and around the chain and keep turning the wheel for sometime for even spread. It's strictly a chain lubricant. Do not use it anywhere else as it is very sticky and mean't only for parts that keep moving constantly. So do not use it for stands and such. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	2	Not recommended product for Oring chains used in KTM Duke 390.	2017-01-11	India		   Used it on my KTM Duke 390 chain, not good at all, as it is more sticky and thus resulting in deteriorating bike chain & chain sprocket life fast.Recommend to use 3M Chain Lube for best results, avoid this product. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Honest review after usage of 2 months: Bike- Honda stunner PGM-FI	2016-08-20	India	8	 I purchased this product in June 2016. These are my observations.Pros:1. Very good at what it does. It lubricate the chain properly.2. Low stickiness to chain. This has some good and bad sides. This means there won't be a lot of waste sticking to the chain and less chain and sprocket damage. eventually to a long lived chain and sprocket. Recommended for open chain bikes.3. Slipping of chain seems reduced and gearing is crisp. I just love the sound of gear shit like tik, tik .4. Less sound from chain.5. long tube to reach most parts of chain.Cons:1. Way too expensive to justify. But if you have expensive bike go for it. Use old engine oil/ gear oil for old, less expensive bikes.2.  Be careful while using the sprayer. My eye feels lubricated now. It is really sensitive.3. Not that usable in rainy weather. I felt like the lubrication got washed away with water.4. Alternatives with near performance are available in Amazon and Paytm.Simply said , if you use a bike with more power than 11 Bhp, you will feel the difference. I wouldn't recommend it for city commuters with low power and low speed.

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	A Valueable Product	2018-12-05	India	One	   Personally, when it comes to chain lube, my opinion is that as long as you clean and lube frequently, I suspect most brand-name chain lubes would work well to protect the chain and keep it running.But of course, there are differences.Likes• Quite Effective• Lubes Your chain very well• Increases chain life• Easy To UseDislikes• Accumulates Lot Of Dust

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Highly Recommended!	2019-06-09	India		   In conjunction with Liqui Moly MOS2 shooter, this seems to have reduced friction in the Gearbox and Drivetrain of my 1989, Yezdi Cl-II, noticeably!I’ve added one, 20 ml, MOS2 shooter to about 1.3 litres (the maximum volume recommended by the manual) of Veedol HDB 50 in the G’box. Also, the day before using MOS2, I’d cleaned the chain with kerosene, lubed it with Motul C2 and left it overnight to solidify – no riding.Now, I’ve not been on a highway ride since using these two products, but what I see now is that, on first gear, I can ride the bike at as low as 9 Kmph (speedometer-indicated) before there is chain snatch – I mean the juddering at low revs that’s typical of all pre-reed valve two-strokes. Before using Motul C2 and MOS2 shooter this figure was between 11 and 12 Kmph (accuracy is difficult as the markings on the s’metre are in increments of 5).  Also, when I put the bike on the centre stand, lift the rear wheel up and spin it by hand, it’s almost noiseless!Previously, in city traffic, the moment the needle approached 10, I’d have to grab the clutch for fear of the bike juddering and stopping. Now, it easily drops below that mark without urging the fingers of my left hand to pull in the lever. To me, this is remarkable!All this is a reliable indicator of reduced friction. Moreover, holding the same speed at a higher gear equals lower revs, which in turn equals reduced wear and tear on engine and drivetrain parts.Being an obsolete model of a redundant brand, critical gearbox and clutch parts of a Yezdi (clutch inner and outer, pushrod, gear shafts, pinions, changer plate etc.) are like the Holy Grail. Hence, I’m very satisfied that friction and, very likely, wear on the aforementioned components has been reduced.

I have a KTM RC 200 and I can't think of a better chain lube. There are other products in the marker but nothing compares to this one. Some people might say this is costly but if you really love your bike, you wont mind this at all.Pros;1. Lubes the chain really well.2. Is viscous and sticks really well.3. Reduces chain noise for a long time.4. Improves chain life.5. Best in class and hence the best seller here.If anyone has any doubt, take my word and buy this blindly, you will never regret it

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Best lube but costly	2016-05-02	India	33	   Best lube but costly.If you plan to use this long term,  it's too costly that it costs the price of new chain sprocket when you buy two cans.According to pulsar manual,  we have to lube every 500 kms  if u follow this,  this lasts 8 to 10 sprays.  So u need one bottle every 5000 kms.By the time u complete 10000 kms on your bike,  u would have spent around 2 bottles cost that is 900₹ approx.  By adding 200 ₹ extra u could have replaced chain sprocket.  Better use gear oil to lubricate chain.  That gear oil costs 50₹ for 500 ml in local oil dealers.  That does the job pretty well.  Think n buy this

Your chain will make clicking noise when you do low speeds. like a bicycle chain going backwards.Clean your chain.This is essential before you can lube your chain. If you dont do this step properly you wont see any benefits.i. Spray chain clean and wait a minute for it to penetrate the dirt and grease.ii. Rub with a tooth brush or a grunge brush.iii. Spray with chain clean and wipe it off with paper towels or a rag. Dont use a rag which is too dirt as it will transfer dirt to the chain.Lubing:After cleaning wait 10mins for the chain cleaner to evaporate.i. Inspect the chain to see if there are any rusting portions. Take care of these first with a brush and some more chain clean.ii. Put bike in first gear and start it. Make sure its on centre stand.iii. Take the straw attachment and point it at the chain. Use the lower part of the chain right before rear sprocket.iv. DO NOT spray on sprocket as it only sticks to the outside of the chain that way.v.. Spraying on the inside is more important as centrifugal force will make the lube penetrate whole chain.vi. Spray on the outer side mildly. Dont more than one pass of the chain as other wise it will spill onto tyres and is badWAIT FOR 15 mins for the lube to adhere to chain before you ride the bike. Inspect to make sure that chain looks uniformly shiny and slick. This means lube has done its job.Clean and lube every 4 weeks.Lube every 2 weeks.You may decrease periods if  you are riding offroad or on dusty roads.

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Does what it says on the tin, but very very well!	2017-03-30	the	13	   I got this to use on my Yamaha XJ6 Diversion. I have used Motul engine oils before but this is the first time I tried their chain lube. I used to use Muc-Off stuff which I tended to get from Halfords but that makes an absolute mess of the back of the bike. My gold coloured rims had become pitch black from the rediculous amount of fling the Muc-Off lube produces. This on the other hand has been a revelation. It is much cleaner and stays much better on the chain than the old stuff ever did. I tend to do around 280-300 miles a week so going by manufacturer recommendations I have to normally lube the chain every 2 weeks. I didnt get the chance to do it last week but the chain still seems very well protected and hasnt been flinging gunk everywhere. In contrast with the previous brand, if I missed the 2 week routine, the chain would be noticeably bare.I realise this is almost as much a slagging off of Muc-Off as it is a positive review of this, but that was what I had to compare with. Overall I am very impressed with the Motul chain lube and would recommend it without reservation. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Would recommend sticking to those instructions	2017-10-16	the	17	   Lube, does exactly what it says on the tin.Would recommend sticking to those instructions.Not for sex. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Excellent lube, great formula	2018-07-11	the	3	   This is by far the best wet lube I have used. For some reason though delivery is now over £4 when it was free before which means it’s nearly £14 a can when it was £10 something before. Not sure what is going on there...Anyway onto the product. It’s the perfect formula. Sticky, but not too sticky. Little fling off, of course you are going to get some, I’m convinced there isn’t a lube that doesn’t fling, but it’s only on the back wheel so nice and easy to clean off every now and again with some degreaser. As I said it’s minimalSticks nicely to the chain and stays on it. Your chain won’t be drying out. Certainly in dry weather anyway. The real test will be when I try this stuff in the rain. Hopefully it performs just as well because the chain wax I was using before made one hell of a mess 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Motul client from now on	2017-07-11	the	5	   I've used Muc Off Products for a while and have to say I was considering moving away from bikes with chain drive due to how messy it was getting. I'm a bit of an OCD with regards to my chain maintenance so I was happy to go back to Motul which an overall better product. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Great chain lub	2019-05-29	the	One	   I use this on my Ducati and it's one of the better ones I've tried, it doesn't seem to attract anything and everything sticking to the chain, i.e. your chain stays clean-looking for some time after an application, and, best of all, it doesn't fling all over your back wheel.  Recommended. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Easy to apply, good covering without fly off	2019-07-13	the	One	   Only use the bike occasionally in dry conditions so can’t really comment on the effectiveness and longevity etc. However easy to apply, hangs on the chain without flying off and that’s about it. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	This or the racing motul lube - 5* best out there	2019-04-05	the	One	   Best chain lube out there. I've spent years trying to find the best one and definitely thing this or the race lube is the best. Stay on for ages. Don't easily flick off. Keeps chain oily and doesn't dry easily from my experience.

Instead of soaking in oil, this aerosol is simple to use. The can is easy to control flow and direct the oil. No mess on me, the garage floor or the bike. Will buy again.

Nice and sticky really does the job my bike gets used in various weathers and kept outdoors under cover. Comes off easily with GT85 spray... 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Great product, highly recommended.	2020-01-22	the		   So, been a life long fan of another well known brand ( starting with W) I decided to try this one, as suggested by a few forum people.  I have to say, it's better than the W.. went on easily, no residue, ridden the bike in all rubbish weather lately and chain still looks great.  No fling either.  Got my vote.. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	2	very good chain lube	2018-06-08	the	One	   very good chain lube, the reason for a low rating is that the nosel on the can broke off very easily making nearly a full bottle going to waste

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Excelente grasa para lubricar la cadena de la moto	2017-08-30	Spain	20	   Se debe aplicar una vez limpiada la cadena (preferiblemente con algún producto que no dañe los retenes O-Ring o X-Ring - yo recomiendo el limpiador de bicicletas de BOMPAR, que es español y tiene una base de queroseno, ideal para limpiar la grasa sin dañar nada)Esta grasa va muy bien en motos de uso en carretera o trail ligero. Con barro habría que usar la grasa Motul C4, más adherente y viscosa.Su adherencia la hace fijarse perfectamente a la cadena.Siempre hay que limpiar y lubricar la cadena cada 1000 kms, y así conseguiremos alargar la vida del kit de arrastre.

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Buon prodotto	2017-03-15	Italy	6	   già utilizzavo prodotti Motul per lubirificare la catena, sempre della serie road e non racing, con catene o-ring e mai avuto problemi. spedizione come da prassi velocissima, in dotazione ci sono due beccucci uno piccolo già montato e quello con cannuccia lunga che si intravede nelle foto sulla sx attaccato al tappo. comoda il fatto che sul tappo, sempre come da foto, ci si possa incastrare il beccuccio che non si utilizza in apposito alloggiamento così da non perderlo. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Il lubrificante da catena che non sporca.	2018-01-25	Italy	6	   Dopo aver provato la versione "RACE" della stessa marca che imbrattava cerchio e carter, sono rimasto bene impressionato dalla questa versione "ROAD" che rimane bene attaccata alla catena come se fosse un adesivo.Ottima durata e meno applicazioni anche se la versione "RACE" sicuramente è più scorrevole e assorbe meno potenza. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Olio lubrificante per catene motul	2019-02-20	Italy	5	   Comprato per lubrificare la catena della mia z900, funziona molto bene e soprattutto rimane immediatamente attaccato alla catena e non schizza per niente 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Ottimo prodotto per tenere la tua moto sempre in buone condizioni	2020-07-23	Italy	One	   Ho acquistato questo lubrificante della Motul perché dopo 8.000 km la catena della mia moto aveva bisogno di una bella pulita e ingrassata. Il prodotto si applica facilmente, la bomboletta spray consente di far aderire il grasso nelle parti interessate senza disperderlo su altre superfici. Al primo utilizzo la catena e quindi il cambio, ne hanno subito tratto vantaggio. Per cui se tenete alla vostra moto, fate una corretta manutenzione periodica oltre ai vari controlli in officina, e acquistate questo ottimo prodotto perché oltre al suo facile utilizzo è sicuramente meglio di tante soluzioni fai-da-te che rischiano di compromettere la trasmissione del vostro mezzo. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Per me, è il migliore.	2018-02-27	Italy	6	   Dopo vari tipi e marche di grasso, ho concluso che nulla batte il motul.Facile da applicare: è molto diluito con solvente per cui, a meno che uno non lo spruzzi senza alcun criterio, è veramente difficile eccedere... con relativi schizzi in ogni dove.Una volta asciutto ha un forte potere adesivo e crea una buona patina protettiva sulla catena, sempre senza imbrattare. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	parfait	2018-12-22	France	8	   Un pshhhit tous les 500 bornes et c'est très bien pour une moto utilisée toute l'année, toutes conditions meteo.Je pense qu'il y a assez de graisse pour 4-5000km... 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Lubrificante per catena ottimo!	2019-10-01	Italy	2	   La bomboletta è dotata di due differenti beccucci, uno corto e l''altro più lungo. Applicato su catena pulita il prodotto mantiene lubrificata la catena anche dopo intemperie o un lavaggio non particolarmente intensivo. Nel complesso prodotto di ottima qualità. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	ottimo	2017-08-19	Italy	7	   prodotto arrivato nei modi e nei tempi della descrizione il prodotto risulta molto buono rispetto ad altri prodotti provati prima risulta decisamente migliore finalmente ho smesso di cercare grassi spray consigliatissimo 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Ottimo	2019-04-05	Italy	3	   Usato per la catena del mio Monster S2R 1000. Se dato a catena calda aderisce perfettamente alla stessa e non schizza addosso ai cerchi. Consigliato. Spedizione e consegna velocissime grazie ad Amazon prime 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Solides, aber ungewöhnliches Kettenspray	2018-12-25	Germany	One	   Ich probiere dieses Spray nun zum ersten Mal aus und kann eine anständige Schmierwirkung bestätigen.Lediglich das Auftragen gestaltet sich anders als bei den Konkurrenzprodukten (auch aus dem Hause Motul).Der Strahl aus der Kanüle hat einen deutlich geringeren Gasanteil, wodurch es schneller zum "Suppen" der Kette beim Auftragen kommt.Leider ist die Kanüle auch etwas zu lang.Diese kürzt man am besten ein wenig ein. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Graisse moto d'excellente qualité	2017-08-02	France	10	   Graisse moto de très bonne qualité qui tient bien même sous la pluie.Facile à pulvériser avec l'embout fourni. Ne laisse pas de trace.Il faut compter 3 ou 4 graissages avant de vider le pot. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	OTTIMO per uso cittadino e autostradale	2020-08-04	Italy		   Oramai uso solo C2 (ho provato anche il C4). Questo grasso adesivo è invisibile perciò la mia catena Oro brilla di luce propria. Inoltre ha ottime caratteristiche adesive e tende a durare bene se non prende pioggia. Ingrassi ogni 600/800 km, il giusto. Ha 2 ugelli (corto e lungo) se usi il lungo non sporchi nulla e il grasso va dove deve andare. La bomboletta non è piccolissima, se da portare in viaggio è ingombrante. CONSIGLIO AL TOP. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Perfecto para cuidar la cadena	2018-02-26	Spain	One	   Lo he usado para lubricar la cadena de la moto que uso por ciudad y ha engrasado perfectamente, incluye una boquilla larga y fina que sirve para canalizar el lubricante y de esa manera no manchar tanto el resto de piezas. Una vez aplicado no gotea, impregna la cadena y durante el rodaje no salpica nada. Muy contento con la compra, la cantidad de producto da para varios engrases 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	the best	2018-03-25	Italy	2	   il miglior lubrificante per catena....non lo cambierò presto!!! non sporca (usato nella giusta quantità)...pulire bene la catena, lubrificare facendo scorrere la catena e poi lasciar agire per 10 minuti in modo da far penetrare il liquido tra le maglie e Oring della catena e far formare la patina protettiva! 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Ideale	2020-09-11	Italy		   Il prodotto è arrivato entro 24 ore, l'ho applicato a catena calda come suggerito dalle istruzioni e poi ho preso la moto dopo un giorno abbondante, la lubrificazione è apparsa subito ottima e con adesione tenace del grasso sulla catena ma ciò che mi ha sorpreso positivamente è la scarsa presenza di schizzi su cerchio, forcella e sottosella dopo l'utilizzo. Rispetto al grasso applicato in precedenza imbratta pochissimo. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	2	Top Preis sehr ergiebig!!	2020-07-28	Germany		   Motul kettenfett benutze ich schon einige Jahre bin total zufrieden. Haftet sehr gut. Auch im Regen verhält er sich top. Leichte Fett Flecken auf dem Felgen, aber das stört mich nicht. Beiden anderen Marken hatte ich schlimmere Felgen.Bis auf diese Bestellung leider ein defekte Dose, ich kann ihn nicht schütteln drinne bewegt sich die Kugel nicht. Ich habe alles getan aber klappt nicht. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Super Dosierbarkeit	2020-07-08	Germany		   Die Dose wirkt sehr hochwertig, alleine durch das tolle Design.Schmierleistung ist super, Durchsichtigkeit auch.Dosieren lässt es sich mit der Mitgelieferten Verlängerung auch super.Ich mache es meistens nach dem Fahren, dann kann es etwas abtropfen und trocknen!kleiner Minuspunkt ist die Haftung. Die könnte etwas besser sein, sonst gut! 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	OTTIMO LUBRIFICANTE	2018-12-04	Italy	One	   Finalmente un lubrificante che non lascia quella fastidiosa patina bianca sulla catena. Ottimo potere di lubrificazione .Da utilizzare chiaramente su catena pulita ha un ottima durata. Spedizione perfetta 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Buen producto, buen precio	2016-01-29	Spain	4	   Buena grasa para cadena de moto. Es bastante líquida, por lo que se reparte bien entre los retenes y sin embrago salpica poco. Lo aconsejable es dejar reposar después de aplicar, es decir, por ejemplo echarla por la noche y así descansa toda la noche, así también se evita que por la fuerza centrífuga, la grasa no se extienda bien por toda la cadena. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Ottimo prodotto per catene moto stradali	2019-09-30	Italy		   Utilizzato per la catena della moto da strada. Facile da applicare e non sporca perché praticamente si incolla alla catena e non  rilascia particelle di grasso. Io lo utilizzo ogni 1000 km dopo aver sgrassato e pulito la catena. Prodotto arrivato nel giorno stabilito, conforme e correttamente consegnato. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Non adatto alle mie esigenze	2020-09-04	Italy		   Sicuramente sarà un buon prodotto, l’ho provato sulla catena della mia moto pensando fosse tipo gel e nell applicare il grasso, essendo liquido ho sporcato la gomma e il pavimento del garage. Preferisco il grasso in gel, peccato lo userò per ingrassare altre cose che non sia la catena della moto 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Sehr Robust, für jedes Wetter geeignet	2019-02-22	Germany		   Dieses Kettenspray ist extrem haftend, dem kann so schnell nichts entgegen wirken. Ich benutze es seit mehreren Jahren und bin immer noch zufrieden mit der Schmierfähigkeit und der Robustheit. Nur sollte man es auch wirklich nur für den Straßenbetrieb verwenden. Ansonsten würde es wohl zu viel Staub und Dreck aufnehmen. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Für mich das Beste	2018-12-14	Germany		   Ich verwende das Kettenspray schon Jahre und finde, es ist eines der Besten. Nach Regenfahrten ist man mit anderen aufgeschmissen. Hier bin ich sicher, dass noch genügend Schmiere auf der Kette ist. Haftet sogar prima und die Felge bleibt sauber. Früh genug schmieren, kann nix passieren :-) 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Distribución homogénea sobre la cadena	2019-09-20	Spain		   Me gusta por no ser muy blanca y se esparce bien.  Aguanta tiempo en la cadena sin desprenderse. Lo que no me gusta es el tacto pegajoso, no se si atraerá mucha suciedad con el tiempo. 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	Buen producto	2019-10-18	Spain	One	   Recomiendo esta grasa para cadenas, es una buena marca y es mas barato aquí que en cualquier tienda física de las que he ido actualmente.

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	5	prodotto eccellente	2016-07-27	Italy	One	   finalmente posso ingrassare la catena da solo...il prodotto è ottimo e la marca una garanzia. io lo uso anche per sbloccare i bulloni arrugginiti e per oliare altri meccanismi. l'unica pecca è che applicandolo sulla catena non lascia colore e quindi non sai esattamente tutti i punti in cui lo hai applicato.

Presenta el mismo problema que muchas otras grasas y es que acabas derramando gran cantidad de producto en su aplicación, siento que tiro parte de mi dinero.

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	サンデーライダー	2019-06-08	Japan	11	   R1000で使用しています。クリーナーで清掃後は、軽くタイヤを回す事が出来ますよね。その後、この製品を使うと若干重くなります。他のレビューにもありますが、吹き付け時は液体ですが、数分で粘度が上がります。布テープの接着面のように、ベタベタの状態にはります。フリクションロスうんぬんを気にする方には、向かないと思います。私ののように、2、3ケ月おきのツーリング使用ですと、粘度が低いとサビが浮き始めます。この製品では3ケ月放置後も、サビ浮きは出ません(バイクカバーはしてます)チェーンの動きは、若干鈍くなったようにかんじますがそのままでもツーリングにいけます。頻繁に乗らない(乗る時間がない)方で、サビ浮きが気になる方にオススメ出来る商品です。

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	透明で飛び散らない。他社の似たような製品より安い。	2018-08-12	Japan	10	   最初はさらさらして金属のすきまにしみ込むが、時間が経つと固まって飛び散りにくくなるタイプのスプレー。スプレーし始めのさらさら感をみると、浸透性はけっこう高そう。透明。固まったあとはすこしベトベトした手触りになる。粘土が高いだけあって水に強いがクリーナーであっさり流れてくれる。量あたりの単価が安い。 
Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	2	ブランド名だけかな…	2019-10-22	Japan	5	   飛び散らないように硬いと噂のこちらを購入しました。吹いた直後はさらさらで浸透性はとても良いです。吹いて数分でベタベタガチガチになるため拭き取りは困難です。耐久性は硬い割には短いですし飛び散ります。乾きが早いように感じました多分300km程で乾き始めます。チェーンの防錆性も期待できないです、拭取りをしなければ防錆効果がありました。硬いためチェーン清掃も大変です。この値段を出すなら他を買うべきかと思います。

Motul_102981_C2_Chain_Lube_for_bikes_(400_ml)	4	Ottimo prodotto, nulla da dire	2017-10-29	Italy	One	   Uso questo lubrificante oramai da diversi anni e su diverse moto. Lo trovo ideale per il tipo di utilizzo che faccio del veicolo. Non lascia traccia per cui a chi vuol vedere dove e come si è posato sulla catena non va bene - cosa che personalmente ritengo da principianti. Magari non è proprio adatto per chi usa poco la moto e ci va piano e non pulisce spesso e bene la catena,stante che rende il meglio a catena piuttosto calda. Per il resto spedizione più che puntuale con consegna prima del previsto

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Changed to this after 300V, satisfied to the limit.	2018-11-27	India	224	   This oil is bang for bucks. It performs the same as 300V which I have been using in my motorcycle for 9000 kms. But, I am a Kida (bug) of the things and I like to read and make my knowledge stronger and confident, I came to know 300V is meant only for racing. Explanation below.-300V is required only if you throw the nuts outta your engine on a race day or drive carelessly in the city also.-It's drainage interval is only 1000-1500kms after this rash riding. Frequent changes should be done due to no detergents in it to keep your engine safe when idle.-Damages your catalytic converter which is there for economy and environment. Race machines don't require such things so 300V can be easily used there.-Requires higher compression ratio in the engines. Meant for bigger engines. Minimum 300CCs. Wastage of money on lower than these CC engines.7100 vs 300V :-7100 is meant for city riding as well as track day events due to detergents as well as the ester too.-7100 is versatile. 300V is race  oriented.-7100 is safe for catalytic converters. 300V is not.-Both are fully synthetic.-Smoothness - Both are same.-Performance - Same but 300V pumps those 2 or 3 bhp more out of the bigger engine.-Drain Intervals - 7100 = Go according to owner's manual (Reason below), 300V = As mentioned above.Myth - Using any fully synthetic oils does't mean that you can use it for longer. It totally depends on your riding styles.If you push you bike to the limits every single time, i.e. only riding on track, you will have to drain 7100 also on 1500kms, if given summer time, make it lesser. Another situation, riding all time at max of 40km/h speeds, will keep your revs and engine heat less too, so 7100 can go longer than specified in the owner's manual by a 1000kms. Its because the oil looses its viscosity (research on this) over the time by the abuse it has to pass in the engine at higher revs and heat. This happens slowly at lower revs, winters, lower engine heats.The owner's manual is made after carrying out a lot of statistics, facts, treatments, experiments. Stick to it. It is made with a combination of abusive and sensible riding conditions.Suppose a bike is due for oil change every 3000kms, change it without ifs and buts. (Keeping in mind you clocked that 3000kms on city too. Only track and full abuse might not make it through. 500kms should be taken away from the above figure.)Tip : Don't change the oil viscosity figures. EVER.So, I guess now you guys know why I prefer 7100 over 300V. Hope you do the same and save yourself some money as well as the catalytic converters of your dear motorbikes.

Go for it and you will never regret it. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	One of the Best engine oil	2017-03-19	India	68	   A bit costly, but you can see the difference in just one day after using this oil. Gear shifting gets smoother for my gixxer sf. Yamaha and suzuki bikes below 180c.c-- a must use product. For over 200c.c. go for 15/20-40/50W motul oil. Provides good protection to engine against heat. Not like other oils that a few days of performance and then its all the same. MOTUL oil provides long lasting performance, I can say this cuz I've used castrol shell motul. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	HAPPY & SATISFIED WITH PERFORMANCE ,BUT GOT A OLD STOCK	2018-05-03	India	31	   Motul 7100,10W40 is seriously working great on my ride ( #RTR160).Did the oil change along with oil filter replacement. I can feel the ride more smoother now and vibrations at low rpm are reduced Little bit.  Only problem is i got a old stock ,but still it doesn't affect the performance. overall i'm satisfied with this. as shell oil is becoming costlier i recommend this Motul 7100 oil for all and especially for RTR owners. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Fantabulous	2019-03-13	India	13	   I own a CBZ Xtreme (2012). Before going to Ladakh, I used 300v, and the change was evident. But on returning from my solo Ladakh ride, I decided to go with the cheaper 7100. And to my surprise, it's even better, it blows me away with the kind smooth gearing and refined ride I am getting from my bike. I am not saying 300v is worse than this, probably 7100 is more suited to my engine. And this may be different for a different bike owner. So, this one is a definite try.

I got my bike checked with my nearest yamaha workshop and according to them it was piston knocking sound and estimate was around 10000 rs . But i just waited sometime to get a second opinion from someother technician . In the meantime i changed my engine oil from yamalube to motul and the engine sound was completely gone. Now after oil change bike has done 700 kms and still i had not faced any issues with the engine . So thanx  Motul for saving  my 10000rs .

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	An essential and a great product from Motul	2019-05-07	India	6	   I have been using this oil for my Suzuki Gixxer 150 for the past 3 years. Not only is this great for the engine, it improves mileage, reduces heat dissipation and  you could literally say there are no vibrations at all as well. The gear shifts has also become smoother. For my bike, I choose the drain interval between 4000-4500kms. I would recommend this oil to everyone.

After moving to Motulgear shifting has noticable change,it's very smooth now and engine sound as well has slight change.With oil filter change 1.45O litres required.And slightly mileage also increased before in display it was showing average mileage as 36 now it's showing 38, I ride in an average speed of 70-80.

Have been using it for my R3 for the last 45K kms and it has been amazing till date.Edit:Have been using the oil for the last 70K kms for my R3. Absolutely brilliant for the purpose I need, touring. If you're doing mid-RPMs, over long distances, Motul 7100 is perfect for your R3 then. Even in city roads, where you can't go to higher RPMs, this oil is perfect.

Also i feel my engine runs a little cooler with this than 300v. But 300v is like an engine upgrade. Acceleration and top end is just the best with 300v. But i think I'll mostly use 7100 from now on, reason being 700 offers a lot in this price tag. And that extra torqu with 300v comes at a cost of more heating

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	3	YAMAHA R15 REVIEW	2019-05-21	India	2	   I own a 2010 r15 all these years I never switched to any oil was using yamahalube only so the difference that I felt after changing to motul was the butter smooth gear shifts you will notice this right away after changing the oil. After 60km the oil came into play pickup is better than before even in 6th gear the pull is good now. I get confuse alot of times now like am I on 5th or 6th no need to turn the gear down for overtakes and the engine heat reduced drastically it's like half now....but but but... I am not getting the top speed that I use to get on yamahalube plus engine don't feel calm its enganged all the time which is kinda good for streets but on highway you need a calm down engine to Cruise.. the crusing speed now is around 75 after that it's like in turbo mode or something while on yamahalube the cruising speed was 85 to 95... So overall it's a good oil loving gear shifts but missing that calm engine... Mileage is same around 40.

It's So far so good till now. before i use to use shell heard about motul had to check it so ordered it. coming to motul its was good. it boosts your speed, shifts are pretty smooth no doubts about it, engine gets heated a bit faster. comparing motul with Shell,  both are same not lot of difference in them but i noticed shell doesn't boosts your speed and engine won't get heated allot it trys to give its best in case of mileage. and thats it. Go for it if you wanna fly. cheers ..!

I just compared with Honda throttle oil. It's better than that because both are at same price. You buy here when there is cashback because it saves nearly 50 to 100 bugs. Engine runs smoothly and clutch works properly. Next time I would try Shell synthetic oil.

The engine now feels at ease even when redlined !!Heating problems has reduced and the gear shifts aren't clunky now, I can't even realise that I am riding the same bike which I used to use on mineral oilThe only point to be noted is starting the engine and idling it for not less than 2 minutes!Failure to do this would not extract the amount of performance and refinement this oil is capable of providing!! 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	Great product but not value for money	2019-12-27	India		   Brought the product for around 700/-. The gear shift are smoother, the bike revs & accelerates better, also low speed drivability is a lot better (you can carry low speed in high gear). But around 4000 km mark all the above positive properties of the oil starts to go away. Before this I used mineral oil and drain interval was 3000 km.So essentially synthetic oil is having a 1000 km dain interval advantage over mineral oil. If I'm paying more than double for synthetic oil over mineral oil then I would expect the drain interval to be higher. Otherwise there no point in spending so much money. So to summarize an excellent product but does not justify the high price tag with poor drain interval. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	It is very good for TVS Apache RTR 200 4v race edition 2.0	2020-06-21	India	2	   I using this to my Apache RTR 200 4v race edition 2.0. I got mileage 40 to 45 kmpl. Very smooth in running. Got high pickup. No heating issues comparing with TVS engine oil. One disadvantage is is that  minimum engine oil capacity of Apache RTR 200 is 1200 ml but it is  come by 1 litre only so that I purchase two bottles. It is so expensive. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	Unleash the true powers of your bike with this oil	2020-01-04	India	One	   Red juice for my fz25. Previously i was using yamalube which was semi synthetic and performance was not upto the mark. First time i changed to fully synthetic with this motul and i cant believe the changes in performance. The engine is much smoother, gear shifts are softer and it is bringing out the true potential of 250CC engine. Worth spending money on this oil rather than showroom oils which last for 3k kms max. Also there is a significant improvement in mileage too.. Must for every motorcycle as oil is the most important thing in your bike. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	One of Finest Fully synthetic Oil	2018-06-22	India	3	   This is one of the best fully synthetic oil for our daily commute. I have used Shell fully synthetic and now tried Motul, i found this a bit better (very minor differences) after upgrading from Shell.Although if you compare it with regular oil (non synthetic) , you will observe so many difference in your bike. You will have improved pickup, better gear shifting, lesser vibrations at higher rpms.

Gear shifts have gotten more smooth and even on traffic during sunny day engine doesn't over heat or loose performance. I loved it so much that I am only gonna use this oil.

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	All rounder engine oil good mileage performance and smoothness with slick gear shifts	2020-07-25	India		   Excellent engine oil smooth gear shifts butter smooth engine even at high revz.Mileage is around 40-50 in my Yamaha Mt15 if ridden under 7400rpm at constant speed.If you redline the bike for long time it gives about 28-30kmpl.Recommended for city and ocassional highway use.For long rides and heavy highway use go for motul 300v or 300vsqaure.Better than Yamalube oil which is semi synthetic oil.Yamalube RS4GP 10W40 fully synthetic oil costs 1300 rupees which is expensive than this oil.Yamalube oil lasts for 3000km.This oil lasts for 5000km so its worth the extra cost.Motul has given drain interval of 8000kms for this oil but I'll recommend to change at 5000kms.If you are switching from semi synthetic Yamalube to this oil than it takes some time to observe change in engine performance say about after 500-10000km you will feel the smoothness in engine.Also I'll recommend to use this oil after using Yamalube for 5000kms.I'll also recommend to flush the old brand oil before switching to another brand engine oil.

I previously used this oil for my cb hornet 160r (this is my second time ) the oil was very good, got good mileage and less vibration compared to other oils, generated less heat compared to semi-synthetic oils, gear shifting is so smooth used the oil around 4.5k kms. If you are using 10w30 or semi-synthetic oil and having idea of changing to fully synthetic go for it totally worth and over all value for the money.

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	Used long term for Yamaha Fz-25.	2020-08-20	India		   I have used 3 cans of this engine oil covering 2 oil changes.Initial impressions:It feels very smooth at the beginning for a couple of hundred kilometers. Heating is as it is not a problem in this bike, but this oil works brilliant in terms of heat control. There is not much change in the noise of the engine. But it feels markedly better than the stock Yamalube.Post 200 kms:The smoothness has settled in but is not as smooth as it was for the first few hundred kilometers. Heat is not an issue, Performance is good.. Longer cruising at speeds about 100 kmph (+/- 20kms) feel much smoother and surer as compared to stock Yamalube.I will change to Shell Advance Ultra with the next oil change to be able to compare the two. Personally I trust shell Ultra Fully Synthetic more, but I have not tried it yet in this bike. It was absolutely wonderful in my last bike.

Bike was due service so decided to bought 7100 4t i was aware of this gem oil before , firstly i did engine oil flush and then poured this nectar in engine.. voila instant increase like 30-40% smoother engine , no knocking sound , gear shifting became so smooth that "click sound of gear change" has gone !! it became totally silent..mileage yet not checked but top end i.e. above 95kmph it becomes totally silent ..great oil for hornet ...i will recommend every hornet owner to change your oil to this.. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	1	Harmful for your bike	2019-10-22	India	One	   The product is completely useless and harmful for your bike's engin.

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	1	Worst oil!	2019-03-16	India	One	   Was smooth the first 1000km then it was awful...vibrations that was not the at 80-100km/h and is kind of rough at idle rpm.Vehicle FZS Fi 2016Weekly run around 70-80kmKms run before changing 2000!(was told to change every 6000km) 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Mind Blowing Performance	2019-10-10	India		   Let me do a comparison here. If I rate vibrations and engine sounds in my Gixxer 155 before Motul as 11 in a scale of 10. Then it is 2 now after using Motul. Mileage improved in beyond charts. With 11 litres of oil in the tank. I rode for well above 450 kms during the Pujas in Kolkata (note the extensive use of clutch and brake due to traffic jams and long periods of driving on 1st gear) and the fuel metre still has 3 bars left after the Pujas. Adding the reserves that makes it more than 3 litres of oil. Adding up everything I believe I will get close to 600 kms from 11 litres of oil.Acceleration has marginally increased and there appears to be mild siren like sound like in moto gp when the bike is exceeds 60 kmph.I am very satisfied with the performance and will stick to Motul until I find something better. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	Less Vibration, Less Sound simply superb but cost is ...	2017-09-28	India	3	   Less Vibration, Less Sound simply superb but cost is too much when compared to other brands.

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	One of the best for FZ 250	2020-08-09	India	One	   Immediately after changing from stock oil on my fz25 the difference was noticible. The gear shifts were dramatically improved and overall the engine performed better on both city and especially on highway. I've used this oil for more than 1000 kms before writing this review. Also I feel there is slight bump in mileage, currently the meter is showing 37.2kmpl up from 33kmpl.

My bikes engine was very happy. Couldn't believe that a different engine oil (100% synthetic)can cause this much difference. I own a VW Ameo. VW and Skoda always use synthetic oil for their cars and now I think it may be the prime reason behind their high performance vehicles. With this engine oil bikes vibration reduced over 40%. Those who can afford the price may try this atleast once. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	smooth for karizma R	2019-10-13	India		   Karizma R users, use only 900ml oil as the manufactures recommends it. Donot over fill as the oil pressure might increase and damage the seals. Use 900ml for 5000 kms and for the rest 1000 kms top up the remaining 100ml. change oil @ 6000 kms. butter smooth oil !! 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Good product	2017-09-27	India	2	   There are a lot of synthetic oils in the market cheaper than this. But motul is a reliable brand. I have been using my bike since 3 years. Ever since my free service got over ive been using this one. If you love your motorcycle go for it. Or go for the cheap ones.

So I would say it's too much pricey and nothing special. You better go with tru4 for Apache 160-200 cc bikes.

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Superb	2020-01-01	India		   I’m the owner of 4 yrs old unicorn 160cc which is 23k kilometres completed. I have used only motul 10w30 semi synthetic then fully synthetic 10w40 then motul 300v 5w30 then 300v 10w40. I observed that motul 300v series is not good for commuter bikes. The motul 7100 10w40 is very best gear shifting is very smooth also bike pickup is very good. Who are thinking to switch full Synthetic engine oil blindly can take motul 7100 10w40.

In early I never try to push the engine to 50 kmph in 4th gear but now it crosses 50 kmph without much effort..i have crossed around 2000 km but still I have n't see any change, the engine oil is just like new.. very good product from MOTUL.....

Go for it and you will never regret it. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	best for karizma in highway riding	2017-05-14	India	6	   For karizma r owners confused with 10w30 and fully synthetic 10w40 here are few points you should consider before purchasing any one of them -10w30 is buttery smooth and gear shifting is much better and vibrations are zero. It doesn't need time to refine your engine compared to stock oil which requires few km of driving to get to optimum temperature for smooth performance. So it is best for city riding. 10w40 on the other hand takes some time just like stock oil to get the bike gear shifting and everything very smooth but once it has taken its time it makes the gear change seamlessly. And if you go beyond 80 on a highway it will still remain as smooth as it can. So if you are riding on highways mostly then the extra amount you pay for it is definitely worth it. Pick up and reaching to 100 is super fast and smooth and engine remains smooth even after that and definitely better than 10w30.So it all depends on your riding style.Hope it helps you. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Motul 7100 is best in its class!!!!!	2016-08-21	India	10	   After 1 month of usage in my Apache RTR , known for its raw and viby engine. The vibration on the lower range is almost went off, in the mid and top range can feel a slight vibration which is totally acceptable considering the nature of the engine. Overall totally surprised how an engine oil can bring in so much change, all Apache riders above 15k in odo just go for it u won't regret it, the extra 300 odd rupee spent over ordinary mineral oil is totally worth it. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	Good Quality Engine oil,Smooth	2017-04-08	India	9	   My Honda Shine (2015) 16k KM facing lots of vibration after crosing 55km, also face overheating. Then i heard abive Motul engine oil. After the use off Motul 10w40 the engine vibration decreased a lot more and the heating issue is reduced. I'm Fully satisfied with Motul 10w40.Thanks to Motul 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Top Performer	2017-05-27	India	6	   I switched to Motul 3 yrs ago. Prior to that I was using Shell for 2 yrs. And for the first 5 yrs I used Castrol power 1. Because of Motul my bike still performs like it was just 2 yrs old. I have used Shell fully synthetic oil. But this Motul is the top performer. Even their mineral oil is better than Castrol power 1. Go ahead and buy it. You won't be disappointed. I ride a CBZ Xtreme. It's 10 yrs old now and I believe by continuing to use Motul​ I can easily stretch it to another 7-8 yrs without a major issue.

Believe me the vibration after 50kmph(which is known to exist on all Honda Shines) has reduced drastically. Wonderful oil. Fully satisfied. Surely you will feel the difference. Worth the price. Blindly buy.Before you fill this Motul Oil clear the old oil completely by using petrol which will wash the old residue and evaporates in sometime. I suggest to go to a local mechanic and make sure he clears the old oil out completely and fills the Motul. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	Worthy purchase for tours and engine efficiency	2017-10-17	India	3	   I own a Suzuki Gixxer 155 and this is company recommended oil/grade for my vehicle.My review:-> Gear, clutch functioning will smooth out further after 20-20 kms ride. Suzuki's engine being ultra smooth, some might not experience measurable different in city ride.-> I tour extensively, that's where the oil proves it worthiness. The acceleration, heat management and ability to keep engine going  for hours is more apparent on highways rather then city rides. I can keep cruising over 75-80 kmph and the mill doesn't break sweat.My recommendation:-> Must buy if you are into touring like 400+ odd kms in a day. City riders can opt for better engine life as well-> Drain period will be between 2.5 kms to 3.00 km if 80% is on highway rides with 75+kmph through your journey-> For city ride, anything between 3.5k kms to 4.00k kms is advisable depending how naughty is your right wristRe-order for sure.Note: My experience is basis Gixxer ownership. Will differ on specific riding condition and habits. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	The best 10W40 out there.	2018-02-10	India	5	   It's the best 10W40 engine oil out there which is pretty much recommended for any regular commuter. But remember just because it's a fully synthetic oil and you pay 700 rupees for 1 litre, doesn't mean that you can run your air-cooled bike for more than 4000 to 5000 km. No matter how much pricey engine oil you use an air cooled engine, it lasts only for 3000 km, so change it for every 3000 km because the oil tends to lose its property by 3000 km on an air-cooled engine.

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	it is better than castrol power one 10w50(fully synthetic) that i used ...	2016-06-04	India	5	   i wud give 4 stars , i've govt karizma r 2010 model and i push my bike over 100kmph almost everyday and it still vibrates but not 2 much, it is better than castrol power one 10w50(fully synthetic) that i used before, engine sound is refined at lower speeds i.e. below 80kmph, but i think for doing speeds over 100kmph motul 300v factory line is the best ,,,, since not everybody has a 200cc bike so jus go 4 it,,, it won't disappoint you. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Very good oil from Motul. A note on viscosity.	2018-05-23	India	2	   Very good engine oil from Motul. Good shear resistance and performance. Always make sure  you choose the right viscosity grade. Some folks go for thicker oils (like the 10W50) when their manufacturer recommends 10W40 thinking it will offer better protection or cooling. These synthetic oils are designed to give your engine max protection at the right viscosity grade. The reality is, running a thicker oil can possibly put extra pressure on the oil pump, rob your engine of power and the thick oil can possibly make your engine heat up more. So there's no point in going for thicker oils if your manufacturer doesn't call for it. Go for a thicker oil only if you know exactly what you're doing. Otherwise you'd be just wasting fuel and losing engine power without any gains. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	FIRST IMPRESSIONS	2018-01-12	India	4	   Today I put this oil in my 2016 Suzuki Gixxer.Previously I was running the stock oil from the service center which is semi-synthetic.The moment I switched to motul my gearshifts become very smooth. Previously they were very hard and finding neutral was tricky as it would either shift in 1 or 2 directly. Now it's very smooth and also the bike feels easier to revv.The first impression of this oil is very good will have to see how it performs in long run.I will update this review once again after 3-4K Kms running this oil.For now if any gixxer owner is experiencing hard gearshifts this oil is way to go although it is bit on the pricier side but you get fully synthetic oil with ester. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	It really feels like riding the bike smoothly even after 100+kmph	2017-08-12	India	3	   I am writing this review after 1 year usage of Motul 7100 10w40 grade oil. .Actually many ppl are saying the draining interval in longer. But don't use it more than 4000 KMS.I own Karizma ZMR  ran 50k KMS as of now. I have noticed that 90 % vibz have reduced and the pick up have increased. It really feels like riding the bike smoothly even after 100+kmph. But don't use fully synthetic oils continuously. Alternatively u should use normal 10w30 and this one. Then u can see the engines awesome performance  . I bought it for 588/-

I'm owning a Bajaj discover 100cc which has been giving me a lot of vibe even at speeds of 50-60 along with engine sound like Zzzzz.I have done a good research over engine oil and selected Motul 7100 10w40, though my recommendation from manufacturer is 20w40.Rest to follow up. .

Better Than Stock Throttle Oil	2018-01-04	India	One	    This is the oil that should be used for daily commute,cruising and the highway revvs as well. . Usage suitable for longer drain intervals.This oil will start working only after the engine heats up , so it takes a few minutes to warm up.Recommend flushing old oil before pouring this In.Though Recommended Qty For CBR 150R Is 1 Litre, 1200ml is better..Bike is smoother ,Vibs Reduced Little, Quicker Acceleration Towards Redline.Sound hasn't changed yet on Day 1 .  I would say for those who wanna extract the extra bhp's out of your engine Go for the 300V variants, Else 7100 Stands out FOR protection of engine.LET IT WARM UP , FEEL THE DIFFERENCE!☺Its A Crimson Red In ColourAnd yes Amazon's delivers leak free oil!Video includedMRP was 810 Got It For 775!

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	The Engine Vibrations just somehow reduces	2016-08-04	India	45	   DELIVERY and PACKAGING:The bottle was packed in a bubble wrap and pouch(no amazon carton), but was delivered on time.IN THE PACK:Just the Oil Container (As Expected).REVIEW:I have been using Synthetic oil for my Hero Honda Karizma R since long, and have tried many brands (just to check which suites my bike). My last change was using Shell fully synthetic 10W40, which did not last long. I normally change my oil(fully synthetic) every 5K Kms, but with shell my bike started giving vibrations issues and gear change problems, before it even reached 5K Kms. Hence had to go for early change.After switching to Motul and driving after approx 250 add kms, I must say that the oil just works. The vibrations are reduced, even in low gears, and my gear issues are also gone.PROS:- The bike vibrations reduce overall, even in low gears- When driving in low gears for long time (in bumper to bumper traffic), the engine performance does not deplete muchCONS:- nothing that I have came across till now, but it's still too early. Will keep updating as time goesVERDICT:Great oil from Motul. Till now, it has stick to my expectations and hope it stays that way. Bike ride is smoother and less painful. Will update as I reach near oil change time.Please Hit the “YES” button If you found this Review Helpful.

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	3	Its Average not as good as OWS	2017-08-10	India	6	   Its Average:On an FZ V2  used this oil for 2000 Km as of date.This Motul is not as good as the German OWS Synthetic Engine Oil. Unfortunately they don't advertise much and it not easily availableI had tried the OWS on a Pulsar and its was consistently smooth.For the 1st 500 KM Motul was brilliant. However over a period of time the Oil seems to deteriorate and harshness increases.Well it will Last 5000 kms however I will again look for OWS if not will try Shell.

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	My review	2017-07-02	India	4	   I used it for my 110 CC Honda Activa recently and it increased the mileage by 15-20 kms. And the engine is running smoother than before. So it should definitely work for all bikes too. Important note : in Scooters, pour only 800 ml in the engine and the remaining 200 ml can be used for the gearbox. Often people change their engine oil but they don't change their gearbox oil which leads to different problems and decrease in mileage. Also you will notice the changes only after riding for 50-100 kms as is the case with any other engine oil. And don't overfill either in the engine or in the gearbox as overfilling will cause the oil seal to rupture which will lead to engine oil leakage. Fill it to the correct and optimum level.

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	For YAMAHA FZ V3 use 10W50 (Hot Temperature Regions)	2020-08-16	India		   10W40: this grade shows that compared to water the oil's viscosity is that many times. 10 means, oil viscosity when it is cold (will be thinner so, it can easily flow when you start your engine in cold climate or in the morning) 40 means, oil viscosity when it is hot (will be thicker, so when the engine is hot, it can give good lubrication).10W50: has more viscosity when the engine is hot, thus good lubrication for your engine even at temperatures around 50, you can feel butter smoothness.Note: I stay in Hot Climate conditions like Goa, so 10W50 suits my bike FZ V3 much better and can be used without any hesitationDo not use low grades oil in Warm Temperature regions, like 5W30 oil where cold flow of oil is excellent but viscosity when it becomes hot is only 30 times of water which is not enough to give good lubrication when the engine is hot.Use Mineral Oil if you do not ride you bike much everyday.If your riding is way much higher or rash then go for Fully Synthetic. Dont opt for mediocre Semi Synthetic, which is waste of money. where you pay more than the price of Mineral oil and also wont get performance of synthetic. So it would be wise to invest a few bucks extra and go for Fully Synthetic and have peace of Mind till 8000kms.

This full synthetic base will last 5500-6000 kms very easily with compact engines like Suzuki,Yamaha, Honda e.tc...  Go for thicker 5100  instead for Indian bike makers e.g, i have one Bajaj pulsar filled with 5100 gives you more smoothness.... i swear... pouring 7100 in Indain bikes may sometimes force you to blame this oil as it might not give you the smoothness vs 5100. Difference is the engine gaping between cylinder head and the pistons which translates which oil you should use. Bike makers generally advice you on that standpoint. So better stick to their advice, they have spent quite a BIG BUCK on testing those machines before releasing it to market." A car makes you a driver, a bike makes you a rider" keep riding!!!

You might already have a +ve opinion about this product, well that's fantastic.I'll just narrate my experience with this product.I bought this for my TVS Jupiter scooter.. But it was recommended to put 10w30 but as i live in hot region & also i was not satisfied with 10w30's performance, as you know TVS engines are raw & viby that's a good thing with various aspects...Okay so after pouring this 10w40 oil, the engine is performing absolutely goodVibrations has been reduced to 60%...Mileage & pick up has been mproved....Engine noise has been reduced ..Overall I'm completely satisfied with mutol's service....It's been almost 3 months engine is running butter smooth, i can feel the difference with 10w30 & 10w40 while pickup & on above 60kmph...Amzing liquid engineering.. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	Switched from Yamalube for FZ25	2020-01-23	India		   It's been 50 km since I used this oil with a change of oil filter also. I expected a lot to change, the smoothness in gear, a little less vibration from the engine. But didn't notice/feel any changes though, I know this is the best engine oil one can get for his/her bike. I use Motul for my RD 350 too, but it's a 2 stroke, 2 cylinders so the output and vibrations are different.I'm still observing how this oil would effect the performance. All I know for now is this oil is way better than Yamlalube Sporty, this oil went charcoal black in just 1000km, I wish I'd show you the photo.

Awesome Oil	2017-03-29	India	4	   Prior to this I used Shell 15W50 Full Synthetic oil and it was replaced in the shell Petrol pump itself. After 1500 Kms it started given me vibration in my Suzuki Access 125. I used the other grade in Shell oil but it did not help. I changed it to Motul 10W40, it's running smoothly without any vibrations. I have used it in my TVS Centra and Pulsar 200, and used it for 10,000 kms without any issues, it includes both city commutes and long trips. I highly recommend this oil in all 4 stroke scooter as well as bikes..;-)

And the gear sifting is smoother than before..

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Recommended for Honda CB Hornet 160R	2017-02-20	India	5	   Package was delivered within the estimated dates, covered in bubble wrap.Was using shell advanced 4t mineral oil since after 1000km on the odometer till now (8000km, 3 oil changes).Previous oil used to make the gear shifts firm and more audible after 1000km of usage, which was annoying at times. Heat dissipation was not good enough and low speed rides were more noisy.Have ridden 400km with this oil , first impression? Engine revs way smoother and is downshifts are drastically smoother (sometimes there is very minimal feedback so I double-check). Engine runs cooler too.Overall a good product, I recommend this oil to any 150cc class motorcycle .

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Oil is Good BUT not for NEW CB UNICORN 160	2016-12-23	India	6	   Motul is Good this 10W40 is  not for NEW CB UNICORN 160 or HORNET . earlier was using 10 W 30 5100 Motul ,which was very good , after my 7000km i decided to try this , but immediately engine was rough sounding and felt hard , so removed completely and changed back to Motul 10w30 5100 , now its smooth and free revving till 8000 RPM and super smooth between 70 to 85 KM/Hr speeds.PS: as per honda , HET engines have the most minimum clearance between engine piston cylinder and cylinder. So thinner oil is recommended by honda ie , 10W30 . Unfortunately full synthetic is not available in this grade. 10W40 oil is in new engines will be smooth but will damage the overall life of piston. Where as in relatively older engines were piston clearance has increased due to normal wear , it can be compensated by slight thicker oil. Like 10W40.

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	4	Good but not for long drain intervals	2020-03-05	India	2	   The performance is good from the oil. But please change the oil around 3500 kms. Oil does evaporate really quickly. I own a r15 v3. I've used the oil for approx 5000kms. While draining the oil, i got only around half litre. Mechanic told me to change this oil around 3k. I've seen reviews seeing that some changes this oil at 10k,8k,etc.. please don't do it. To make things clear i ride a bit roughly. I occasionally redline my bike. That may be the reason of evaporation. But its a fully synthetic oil which is priced twice than the yamalube. But it doesn't last long. But performance is good , oil retains its viscosity very well even under heavy use.

IT IS GENUINE PRODUCT... I got Jan 2020 batch product...And 7100 is awesome.I used 20w50 for my bullet electra 4s and found phenomenal difference. And hence bought this 10w40 for my Yamaha MT15.Will update the review on MY15 after i replace oil. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	good product	2020-06-28	the		   i have always used Motul for my bikes and as usually best oil in my opinion 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Exzellentes Öl!	2020-08-02	Germany		   Das Motul 7100 4T in der Viskosität 10 W-40 hat durchaus seinen Preis.Nach dem Wechsel auf dieses Öl wird allerdings auch klar warum!Beim vorigen Öl (namhafter Hersteller mit Muschel und Empfehlung laut Handbuch)war in einigen Fahrzuständen trotz eingestellter Kupplung leichtes Kupplungsrutschender Nasskupplung zu verzeichnen.Ein Verschleiß der Kupplungsbauteile konnte aufgrund der Laufleistung ausgeschlossen werden.Mit dem Öl von Motul ist dieses Problem zumindest bei meinem Bike Geschichte.Kein Kupplungsrutschen, knackige Schaltvorgänge und ein gefühlt geschmeidigerer Motorlauf überzeugenauf ganzer Linie. Das war so vorher nicht zu erwarten.Die von Motul beworbene "Ester-Technologie" scheint hier ihren Zweck in vollem Umfang ausspielen zu können.Unter Beachtung der richtigen Wahl der Viskosität beim Kauf kann ich dieses Öl bedenkenlos empfehlen.Vor allem Modelle mit Nasskupplung können von diesem Schmierstoff profitieren... 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Ottimo anche per scooter	2018-09-15	Italy	One	   Ho voluto provare quest'olio su Honda SH 125i stanco del classico Castrol che ogni volta è un'impresa riuscire a trovare a prezzi decenti. Devo dire che questo Motul non ha niente da invidiare al Castrol, il motore gira bene e l'erogazione è sempre fluida. Magari per qualcuno potrebbe essere esagerato usare un olio così valido su uno scooter ma ne vale la pena se ci tenete al vostro motore.

Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	Uno dei migliori oli in circolazione	2017-03-22	Italy	4	   Lo uso per il mio Sh che oramai ha compiuto la bellezza di 12 anni. Nonostante "da libretto d'uso e manutenzione" sia indicato di utilizzare il Castrol 10w-30 vi ASSICURO che su un motore vecchiotto un olio sintetico al 100% e soprattutto 10w-40, quindi più viscoso, è molto molto meglio. I motori vecchiotti si sa, tendono a bruciare più olio, discorso che vale soprattutto per l'Sh che ne brucia un bel po' anche quando ha pochi km (è proprio una delle sue caratteristiche). Fare un bel cambio d'olio e caricare questo Motul 10w-40 mi ha cambiato la vita, consumo veramente la metà d'olio rispetto a prima e anche la marcia è molto più fluida. Lo consiglio vivamente. 
Motul_104091_7100_4T_Fully_Synthetic_10W-40_Petrol_Engine_Oil_for_Bikes_(1_L)	5	an excellent product	2020-05-05	the		   The right oil for my yamaha mt10 bike. I got the small bottle because my bike takes 4.1 litters and the regular big bottle comes in 4 litters, so that's an addition and lasts for about 9-10 additional adds to the 4 litter bottle.By accident I was putting 5w40. I don't know where I was looking at when was ordering and putting it in the bike. Not that big of a deal but the engine is designed for 10w40, so I'm or the right track now.Fully synth could give you clutch issues in a long term but not because of the oil but because of the clutch =]

Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Very satisfied with the product	2018-08-25	India	15	   Best chain clean available in the market. Do not go for cheap chain clean available on petrol pump.Some people tend to apply kerosene on the chain to clean. I don't know if it is harmful to the chain or not but I rather stick to traditional way of cleaning chain which is using chain clean.Using this product since 2 years and very satisfied with the product. After application within 2 minutes all the dirt starts falling of your chain. I do a 2nd coat after 5 minutes and then use brush to clean any left over debris etc. Post that wait again for 5 minutes and then move on to apply chain lube. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	4	Motul Chain Clean	2020-02-01	India	5	   For the 1st time, i did my bike chain clean on my own. I was worried about to buy via online, but surprisingly it's great.Step:1 Spray some amount of C1 cleaner towards chain & dry it fa a whileStep:2 Wipe the chain with a Cloth & a tooth brush so that waste particles from the chain will be removed. Leave it fa while (20mins)Step:3 Take C2 Chain Lube & spray it in the Chains by manually rotating the wheel Clockwise. Make sure u spray less amount of Chain Lube ( not like a BODY SPRAY) bcz while running it'll stick to Bike alloy wheel.Step 4: Leave the bike in sunlight fa another 7-8 hrs & take ur bike fa ride next day morning for effective results.Note: I've used only these C1 Chain Cleaner, for better cleaning u can use either DIESEL or KEROSENE for CHAIN CLEANING. These bottles (150ml) can be used 3-4 times roughly. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	1	Review for seller and not for the product	2019-01-15	India	7	   Have been using Motul C1 and C2 for cleaning chain of my street triple and was always satisfied but this review is not for the product but for the seller as the quantity was way too less than what I used to get previously. Two Cans of chain cleaners (150 ml) did not even last to complete a single cycle of chain cleaning. Not happy at all. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Excellent product from motul	2018-10-15	India	4	   The main reason for buying this product online was that I could not find this product in my city. I searched for almost 20 automobile stores and no where I couldn't find this product. Both chain cleaner and lube works very well. Chain cleaner removes all the dirt and sand from the chain where as the lube acts as a lubricant and reduces the chain sound while driving and it also doesn't allow chain to dry soon. Don't apply oil to the chain as it serves only temporary purpose. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Superb !!	2017-06-19	India	7	   Firstly Please use a mask before applying this. Apply it and rub chains clean after some minutes.Using It to clean My RE 350 Classic. Overall Satisfied.

Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Must have for all bikers!	2019-12-10	India		   I never ride without it... Touring that is and it's always with me at home too as its cost effective if you consider taking your motorbike to service centre for something you can do on your own. I own a KTM Duke 250 and this product has given a good 15k km range to my chain and sprocket set. Go for Motul! 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	4	Can't go wrong with this one if you apply it generously. Reasonably priced!	2018-03-24	India	3	   Reasonably priced consudering it's Motul. The can doesn't last that long. I use it for cleaning my cycles, too, although I've stopped now as Kerosense does a better job at a fraction of the cost. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	3	Good but not best!	2017-09-18	India	2	   Cleaning was good but not as good as Kerosene (although it is hard, but its very effective). You just brush with kerosene, clean and wipe it off with cloth instantly. Its more cheap and effective 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	2	Excellent Chain cleaner.But some issues too.	2016-11-27	India	2	   The product is good. No doubt in that. But when I opened the can and presses the nozzle, the can starts leaking. To use it, I have to make sure the CAN is to be hold in Vertical position or perpendicular with the ground. I didn't expected the product to be of this type. I think I can't even replaced it since I've used it. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Clean your chain	2019-08-10	India		   This is a well known brand for cleaning your bike chain. It works as described. Just put your bike on center stand and start it in first  gear. Then spray the chain with this can from behind with a steady hand. Use it after every 500 km run. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	3	Little disappointed.	2020-02-14	India		   Product I received is not sealed. It might be a used one. Hence doesn't know how much the quantity left. Doesn't expect this from cloudtail India.Product is original but the quantity left don't know how much clean it goes. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Does what it is supposed to very effectively	2018-10-16	India		   Does what it is supposed to very effectively. You will need more C1 as compared to C2.I almost used 600 ml C1 for 200 ml C2. I might be doing something a little wrong but definitely you will need twice the amount of C1 as compared to C2. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	4	Product is fantastic but very expensive	2019-05-08	India	One	   I like this product because its highly effective and easy to use. This is second time i have purchased this product in same month. Though i am very happy with the quality of product at the same time i am little disappointed with the pricing. Since the chain cleaner is used by active cyclists very often the pricing should be little more realistic. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Nice viscosity	2020-09-06	India		   Spray it on the bike chain, wait for 2 mins and brush the greasy links. Redo this and then wipe the chain with a cloth. Later, use the chain lube for chain lubrication.Warning: dry your chain completely before applying lube or the chain will get saggy while runing bike 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	4	Good but pricey	2019-01-07	India		   I like the 3M product better due it's bigger can. Both do the same job. This can just seems to finish in a few uses.

Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	3	Product is awesome.  Not the delivered one.	2016-10-29	India	8	   Product is awesome.... No doubt about that. Recieved a product with date of manufacturing as Feb, 2015. A 21 month old product on 29 October 2016 with some clumsy packing and labeling. Motul gives a performance guarantee for 24 months only. Initiated process for replacement. Spoke to customer care and they were very helpful. Replacement request taken and another product supplied. Recieved replacement also from the same lot of Feb, 2015. Cannot wait for another replacement. Sought refund which is in progress. Either customer feedback is not transferred to vendor or vendor doesn't take feedback seriosuly. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	1	Product received damage - unusable now !	2015-10-25	India	15	   The Motul C1 Cleaner product was received in damaged condition. The spray/dispenser cap was broken.  Unfortunately there is no return policy for this product ! ! !The Motul 300V 1 liter X 2 nos were also packed in same parcel which are ok. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	4	Does the job really well.	2016-07-11	India	6	   Bought this 3 months ago for 475 rupees. This is the first chain cleaner I've tried till now so can't compare with other products. Now coming to the review, the product performs really well, spray this on your dirty chain and watch most of the grime, dust and other particles drip down even before using any brush or cloth. Let the spray settle in for 10-15 minutes and then use a brush or cloth to remove the remaining gunk. Spray only as many times as the chain requires. For the price I bought, it felt slightly on the expensive side, but it's from the reputed brand of Motul. Go for it if you don't mind the slightly higher expense for even better maintenance of your Bike. This chain clean is to be followed by a chain lube(Preferably Motul's).Other reviews and lots of Youtube videos explain you how to use the product correctly.

Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	1	Useless product	2017-06-20	India	4	   The product received didn't even lasted for 3 sprays. Earlier I had used 3M spray which was 75ml, and believe it or not it gave me around 7 sprays(7 times used). But this time I used Motul 150ml, I expected to use it around 15 times but it was empty within 3 times of usage. I think they delivered me a used one. Such a crap 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Best chain and sprocket cleaner till date !!	2016-08-14	India		   Does its job well. Removes dirt, grease, paste of sand mixed with lubricant, and shows the true metal surface which is best for applying lube. Then reward your chain and sprockets with Motul C2 lube for best protection and lubrication.Yes I agree that its costly but costly due to import duties and excise taxes, since it is imported from Motul Corporation France. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	4	Very Good	2016-12-21	India	2	   Very good product.... Afterall it's Motul....Cleans very fast and dries the surface also very fast...The only bad thing is a 400ml bottle can be used for a single cleaning job.... After that its empty.... Soo according to this its price is high...

Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	2	Too expensive and not worth it.	2017-07-21	India		   No doubt that the product is good, but just buy a spray bottle and Diesel and it does the same thing. Why spend close to ₹500 when it can be achieved in a one time cost of ₹50 for a spray bottle and Diesel which is 10 times cheaper.

Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	4	It is MOTUL. You expect the best.	2017-09-29	India		   It's MOTUL, after all. No drama, whatsoever. But if you're really into keeping your chain clean, then I'd suggest buying the larger capacity one as it will be a more VFM option. This one is too less to do a proper cleaning and will get over in 3-4 times.

Wanted to buy lube but ended up buying this since it got listed even though i filtered for lube. I thought i'll return this product  without opening and buy lube but it 'falls' under a 'certain' category of products which amazon wont take return. so i had to live with it for no reason. :(

I used it on several of my bikes and I don't find any smoothness after cleaning and applying this. But when I use normal HP gear oil I can feel the smoothness after each cleaning. Plus this stuff is so sticky. Also it gunks up the rims and sprocket areas. Every time I use this it some how gets into the rear disk and rear brake doesn't work for 10-20kms. Using a cardboard also doesn't help as the vapours from the spray will spread everywhere. IMO it's much better to get 90w or 140w gear oil and clean and change every 300kms. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	2	Motul C1 Cleaner Vs WD40	2020-06-24	India		   So I have used both motul C1 Cleaner and WD40 from my last 2 years of bike chain cleaning experience I would recommend WD40 . Motul does the job but not in comparison with WD40 it works like a charm. Motul Chain clean is a slow process but when it comes to WD40 it gives you instant results ...just apart and start cleaning with a brush or dry rag. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	4	Multipurpose and good quality	2017-05-21	India		   Good product for bicycle, motorcycle chains. You can also lubricate switch gear, protect suspension fork seals, lubricate hinges, door latches etc. You also use it to protect metal from moisture. What is good about Motul product is that it dries soon and forms a thick coating of silicone based lubricant that can protect your O-rings. I have not tested it for O-rings in photography equipment yet. Its has multiple uses and you will love it. I guess you can use it on your cars, where ever grease is used. In India, mechanics tend to put a big mass of grease which becomes a headache. You can perhaps replace grease for some applications, with this. Motul knows its work well. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Excellent product	2017-11-16	India		   Excellent product for chain lubrication in combination with motul chain lube. But economic only for high end bikes with costly chains. Because a normal bike chain sprocket set itself costs between 800-2000. So not worth it to use a lube combo worth 1000. Use only engine oil and kerosene for normal bike chains. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	3	no needof thiscostly product	2019-09-21	India		   i am wondering why i even brought his, 150ml for 225 rupess????  tooo costly the same cleaning will be done by 50rs 1 ltr diesel ,dont waste money on this

Never buying this lousy thing again! 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	This is the only product to consider for chain cleaning	2015-11-21	India	8	   This is the only product in the market which is used by all leading bike manufacturers workshop. Because it is not only reliable but also a very effective on chain cleaning. I am using it with chain lube (which is MOTUL C2 Chain Lube Road). First have to apply C1 chain clean and leave it for 5 to 10 minutes then brush it or blow it with air compressor after it apply MOTUL C2 Chain Lube Road and then chain is "MAKHAN"..... Recommend every one to try it, chain looks new.

Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Top Produkt	2019-04-05	Germany	10	   Da meine Kette noch recht frisch ist, waren noch keine größeren Verkrustungen vorhanden. Durch Regen war jedoch - trotz Plane - Flugrost aufgetreten.Wie langlebig eine Kette ist, hängt davon ab, wie man sie pflegt. Vor Saisonstart gehört es für mich dazu, die Kette einmal komplett zu reinigen und neu zu fetten, und somit sauber in die neue Saison zu starten (während der Saison pflege ich natürlich auch).Wie auf dem Bild zu erkennen, konnte ich den Flugrost entfernen und die Kette sieht 1A sauber aus!Ich empfehle die Verwendung einer Kettenbürste und an besten sollte man einen Auffangbehälter unterstellen. Während des Aufsprühens ein Stück Pappe hinter die Kette halten, damit das Zeug auch nur dahin kommt, wo es hin soll.Anschließend gut fetten. Hier habe ich auch auf ein Motul-Produkt zurückgegriffen.Allzeit gute Fahrt :-)

Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Bester Kettenreiniger	2019-07-06	Germany	5	   Ich habe schon andere Kettenreiniger in Kombination mit einem Kettenreinigungsgerät von einem großen Motorradversandhaus ausprobiert, allerdings hat mich der Motul Chain Cleaner überzeugt.Er verfliegt schnell und legt trotzdem einen leichten Schmierfilm auf die Kette.So muss man keine Angst haben dass das komplette Kettenfett zwischen den Ringen raus ist.Einfaches aufsprühen auf die Kette und einen druntergehaltenen Lappen und man kriegt mit ein paar Wischbewegungen den ganzen Dreck und das alte Fett ab.Nach einer Arbeit von ca. 20 min sieht die Kette und der Kettensatz aus wie neu.Danach einfach 1-2 Stunden warten bis alles getrocknet und verflogen ist und die Kette kann wieder geschmiert werden. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Gutes Zeug Kaufempfehlung	2019-10-04	Germany	5	   Gute leistung. Bin beeindruckt. Da der vorbesitzer meines motorrades sich nicht um die kette gekümmert hat, sah sie wie auf dem linken bild zu sehen ist sehr mitgenommen aus. Viel dreck und auch rost hat sich da angesammelt. Hatte schon angst das da nix mehr zu retten ist. Mit dem zeug hier ging aber bereits nach wenigen sprühern und einfachen wischen mit nem lappen der grossteil des drecks weg(siehe rechtes bild).Alles natürlich nicht aber der rest ist hauptsächlich rost.Habe mir noch mal ne flasche bestellt und werde nach erneuter reinigung nochmal aktualiesieren.Alles in allem ein gutes produkt und wenn eure kette nicht ganz so mirgenommen aussieht wie meine vorher reicht die flasche bestimmt für 2-3 reinigungen.Bei mir leider nur für eine :D 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Sgrassa alla grande	2018-04-29	Italy	5	   Consigliatissimo fa benissimo il suo lavoro lo uso anche per la bici e per la moto quando voglio avere la tua catena pulita non hai i segni di nero neanche tra le dita Basta applicarlo semplicemente spruzzando sulla catena aspettare 5 minuti per asciugatura ed ecco fatto la catena è come nuova è pronta per essere ingrassata consigliatissima e grazie Amazon perché sei il numero uno Per le consegne puntuali e precise 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Buen limpiador de cadena	2020-01-19	Spain	2	   Lo lleve para un viaje a marruecos en donde la cadena de la moto se llena de suciedad si vas a hacer off, y en el desierto no hay muchos sitios con mangueras para limpiar la cadena, así que me decidí a usarlo y fue fantástico, cada día debes de limpiar y engrasar la cadena y este producto combinado con el aceite especial de esta marca para offroad son la combinación perfecta para el mantenimiento de tu moto en situaciones extremas. Deshace la porquería que se mete entre los eslabones. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Gute Reinigungswirkung. Motul Qualität	2018-06-10	Germany	5	   Da man seine Motorradkette ab und zu (alle 800-1000km) Grundreinigen sollte, hab ich mir den Motul Chain Clean zugelegt.Ich muss sagen das funktioniert einwandfrei, einfach aufsprühen, kurz anlösen lassen, dann brüste ich nochmal komplett über die Kette um die Verkrustungen zu lösen, danach nochmal absprühen und fertig. Die Kette sieht danach fast aus wie neu.Danach wird wieder mit Motul Chain Lube Road Plus gefettet. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Prodotto eccellente sotto tutti gli aspetti.	2019-09-27	Italy	One	   Probabilmente tra i migliori, efficacissimo nel rimuovere qualsiasi tipo di grasso o morchia, quanto delicato e totalmente inerte verso plastiche, parti in carbonio e policarbonati (ho fatto numerose prove in merito, non rischio di ombreggiare o peggio rovinare parti estetiche per nulla), nonché ovviamente verso Oring di ogni tipo. Vado in moto da oltre 25 anni e avrò provato decine e decine di prodotti presenti sul mercato per quanto riguarda la cura e manutenzione del veicolo. Credo di essere arrivato al detergente definitivo per quanto riguarda la trasmissione finale. Consigliatissimo senza ombra di dubbio. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Recomendable para dejar la cadena como el primer día	2020-04-19	Spain	One	   Nunca había limpiado la cadena en dos años de uso. Siempre me había preocupado de engrasarla, pero no de limpiarla. Es muy recomendable y con este producto es muy fácil, con resultados profesionales. Recomiendo poner un cartón debajo porque saca mucha suciedad. Haced caso de las recomendaciones del fabricante en cuanto a seguridad. Yo me puse gafas de protección y me alegro porque me saltó producto. Lo volvería a comprar. Motul es garantía. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Miracoloso	2017-05-17	Italy	4	   Prodotto acquistato insieme al grasso motul c4, svolge il suo lavoro magnificamente, non lavavo la catena da un anno ed era sporchissima e vicino al pignone si era formato tutta sporcizia tra grasso, terra e sabbia. Ora la catena sembra nuova, tornata lucida come a una volta e scorre alla perfezione senza un minimo di rumore strano. Spedizione arrivata in aticipo e imballaggio sicuro.Credo sia uno dei migliori prodotti sgrassanti per catene in circolazione, sicuramente lo ricomperò in futuro, consiglio! 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Sehr guter Reiniger	2019-06-26	Germany	2	   Hab das jetzt zum ersten Mal an meiner Kette benutzt. Hab sie ca. 5000 km nicht gereinigt nur 2x gefettet, und die Kette war wirklich verdreckt.Dann diesen Reiniger aufgesprüht- und es fing gleich an dass der dreck auf den Boden lief - ( Pappe darunter gelegt) ca 5 min einwirken lassen dann mit einem Tuch abgewischt und der ganze dreck war abgegangen, wirklich toll. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	fa quello che deve	2018-11-05	Italy	One	   Ho acquistato lo sgrassante per la catena della mia moto, ho seguito le istruzioni, semplici, di utilizzo e sono finalmente riuscito a riportare a specchio la catena. Sicuramente per catenme sporche come la mia una sola applicazione non è sufficiente e inoltre consiglio di lasciare agire e poi dotarsi di una spazzola e di uno strofinaccio per rimuovere meglio il grasso disciolto. Per il resto devo dire ottimo prodotto. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Zu empfehlen	2020-06-21	Germany	One	   Ich nutze seit langem Motul Kettenpflegeprodukte an meiner Triumph Speed triple. Super Reinigungswirkung, lösst Fett-/Dreckrreste bestens ab. Zusätzlich nutze ich eine Kettenbürste um den Reiniger gleichmäßig zu verteilen. Anschließend mit Reinigungspapier die Reste entfernen, trocknen lassen und neues Fett/Öl auftragen. Ich reinige ca. alle 500-800 km. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Ich benutze nie wieder was anderes!	2020-09-09	Germany		   Das Zeug ist wirklich der Hammer und bisher habe ich nichts vergleichbares genutzt. Selbst bei starker Verschmutzung und Verkrustung löst das Mittel schon alles in sekundenschnelle. Mit einem Tuch einmal über die Kette wischen und sie blitzt quasi schon von alleine! Der Geruch ist auch total unauffällig, ich hatte eher Schleimhautreizungen erwartet, aber ich hab den Reiniger kaum gerochen. Für die Leistung, die das Zeug vollbringt, und für die gesparte Zeit (wir wissen ja alle wie Kettenreinigung einen fertig machen kann) ist der Preis vermutlich auch unschlagbar. Ich werde definitiv nichts anderes mehr benutzen! 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Pratico	2020-07-17	Italy		   Spedizione rapida, ottimo sgrassante per catene, lo utilizzo con l'aiuto di una vecchia asciugamani che poi butto. Anche se la catena sembra pulita, il grasso esausto e nero sembra non smetta mai di finire, dopo tre o quattro giri di catena inizia ad essere davvero pulita. Ricordate di fare sempre questa operazione a motore spento e su cavalletto alza ruota posteriore per evitare gravi condizioni di pericolo. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Eccezionale	2017-07-19	Italy	3	   Un prodotto fantastico pulisce molto bene la catena, si spruzza  e si lascia agire  ma ovviamente non fa miracoli, la catena va sempre strofinata con un panno o con uno spazzolino vecchio e poi ingrassata.Comunque mettere la moto su cavalletto e pulire la catena con petrolio bianco è indubbiamente molto  meglio.Se la catena non e' eccessivamente sporca va bene. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Magnifico	2020-08-18	Italy		   pulitore per catene moto spettacolare, lo uso per la mia cb650r, lo dai all'interno della catena senza esagerare, con uno straccio avvolgi la catena e la fai scorrere, la catena torna nuova, quasi luccica giuro, poi aspetti 5/10 minuti che il prodotto asciughi bene e dai il grasso, io uso sempre il Motul, anche questo top di gamma, non schizza ed è bianco, vedi molto bene dove lo hai dato!Ne farò una scorta 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Wirklich toll	2020-08-24	Germany		   Ich habe ein paar Bewertungen gelesen in denen die Käufer unzufrieden waren und hab sie Gott sei Dank ignoriert.Meine Kette ist schon 15 Jahre alt und wahrscheinlich nur bei der Fertigung sauberer gewesen.Ja, man braucht ein bisschen mehr davon und dann wird die Dose halt schneller alle, und ichwürde auch immer eine Bürste nutzen und nicht nur das Mittel sprühen, aber ansonsten ist das Reinigen ein Kinderspiel und das Ergebnis toll. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	4	Producto ideal	2019-08-09	Spain	One	   El producto es perfecto para su propósito. La velocidad de entrega es perfecta. El único defecto es que no sé para que se pone el campo de comentarios en la dirección si no se le va a hacer caso. Puse que si no estaba en casa se entregase en casa de mi vecina y no le aparecía dicha información al servicio de correos.

Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	5	Muy buen resultado	2020-08-31	Spain		   Producto de marca reconocida que comprado a buen precio es un acierto. Lo llevo usando desde hace años para la limpieza de la cadena de la moto, solo hay que pulverizar sobre ella y con un trapo de algodón frotar para retirar los restos sucios. Realizando la limpieza de la cadena, corona y piñón cada 3000km el envase de 400ml me permite hacer entre 5-7 limpiezas. 
Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	4	Muy buen producto y buena cantidad	2019-08-08	Spain	One	   He probado varios limpiadores de cadena y este me gusta especialmente por la cantidad de producto, que te permite hacer varias limpiezas, lo que hace que lo amortices bien.

Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	3	可もなく不可もなく、頑固なルブを落とす時に。	2019-01-02	Japan	2	   モホGPでもスポンサードしているMOTULであれば間違いないだろうというブランドイメージでまず購入。同時に購入したC4というレース用のルブとセットで使用を始めて1年半が経過。C4というチェーンルブは粘性が高いが飛び散りはそこそこあり、チェーン本体とチェーンケース、スプロケカバーに堆積しガム状になっていた。変性したC4ルブにコイツを吹きかけ、ブラシで擦ったりウェスで拭き取るといい具合で落ちてくれる。しかしその他メーカーのパーツクリーナーと何か大きく違い優位性があるかと言うと、こだわりが無ければ正直特に無いだろう。また、使用7ヶ月でメンテサイクル200kmだった純正525チェーンのシールも破損した。これのせいか、純正チェーンの耐久性の無さかよくわからないが、シールや樹脂部分の攻撃性も検証したい所。

Io l'ho usato regolarmente ogni 3-4000 km contro i 1000 consigliati e nonostante ciò mi ha causato (a detta del meccanico) la rottura precoce degli o-ring perché si sono seccati ed induriti.

Motul_C1_102980_Chain_Clean_(400_ml)	3	普通	2018-01-06	Japan		   チェーンの掃除用に購入しました。ジェットの噴出力は強いですが、かといってチェーンの汚れが吹き飛ぶほどではありません。ネットで調べると動画が上がっていましたが、期待するほど効果はありませんでした。ただ揮発性は結構高めで10秒くらいで乾きます。今までワコーズやそのほかいろいろ使いましたが一番いいのはパークツールのガラガラやるやつですね。あれとシンプルグリーンの洗浄液の組み合わせが一番です。

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Used it on Royal Enfield classic	2018-10-25	India	580	   Some reviews say that a wrong product was shipped to them, but if you read the description it should say it's for 4 stroke 2 wheelers.Coming to the product, it does what it says. It cleans out your old oil better so that residues of your old oil don't affect your newly changed oil.Pro tip:1. Plan your oil change2. Run the vehicle for atleast 10km before initiating the oil change for the oil to become thin3. Add the 3M oil and run the engine on 1st gear with centre stand on for 15 min4. Now instantly open the valves and change the oil before the oil temperature comes down5. Shake the bike from side to side gently to release all left overs from the bike6. Change the oil filter7. Close the valves and fill with new oil8. Wait for 10 to 15 min for oil to seep into the engine components9. Change in performance can be felt after driving for 20 to 50km depending on the bike.Mark this review as helpful if it helped you in making a decision 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	VERY GOOD PRODUCT.	2018-06-09	India	179	   Used this small shot for my 8 year old PULSAR 150 first time. Amazon is best, delivered in 2 days. Very genuine with latest packing with 313 MRP. Poured all 50 ml to the engine oil and run engine for 10 mins on idle.Engine oil after drained has some rusty color not dark black as usual and became very less viscous. Seems flush really done it's effect.After that used Motul 7100 20W50 fully synthetic that as well for the first time in my entire bikes life.Now, the results are awesome. Within just 8-10 KM of run engine feels free, no resistance at all, very smooth, gear shifting as well becomes very smooth. Hope this effect  remains same after few thousand km of run. Shall update review after few months. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Works as advertised	2019-01-22	India	73	   This is the first time I am using engine flush. I do small jobs myself rather than giving it to a mechanic. The packaging and delivery were spot on. no leaks in the package. the print on the back says to use it in one go. I decided to experiment and used it in another way. the first foto shows the existing oil which i drained without using flush. it was sooty and dark. Then i added a cheap servo 20w30 1/2 litre and half of the flush , put the engine on idle for 10 mins and drained.  expected to see some soot but was totally surprised to see the new oil change its colour to the same one as before. next added the remaining half of both flush and servo oil.idled for 10 mins with some throttle and drained. same situation but the last oil that dripped was  a bit lighter than the earlier. Finally filled up with shell ax7 .engine runs smooth now .. need to check after 1000kms or so. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	Not Required for Oil Filter Bikes	2018-10-13	India	35	   If your bike has Oil filter and you frequently get it replaced, you need not to buy this one for your bike unless your bike has piston issues (smoke releases from Muffler).If your bike has Oil filter, it generally cleans the running engine oil and hence you won't find much difference. Otherwise if it is Avenger kind of bike without oil filter, this flushing oil is quite helpful. :-) 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	3	Nothing great	2018-10-05	India	28	   Just a normal flush did not noticed any change, I don't know how people noticed the change in the performance. I have purchased this product after reviewing many sites and blog seems its all about their perception.. No such change you will notice... It is just a normal flush.. I have PULSAR 200NS 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Small Pack but Big Hitterr.....	2018-12-04	India	10	   Its an amazing product...lets move to reality, today i tried this on my CBR 250R ABS, before mix i just run the bike 7-8 km @ speed of 90km/h with high rpm bcz all the old oil will turn into very thin then i mix the 3M engine oil flush into the old oil then start the engine with a idle speed of 4-5k rpm & thoroughly increased rpm upto 15 mints....Then i drained all the old oil but be care full the old oil might be very hot - thin & u should wait at least 15 mints till last drop/u should move ur bike left to right till last drop. If ur engine have a oil filter, changed it then add the new oil to the engine & start the engine with a idle speed of 1.5-2k rpm leave it upto 10 mints....Lets see now the oil level might be low but it will increase thoroughly to top level, no need to worry....At least u have to drive ur bike with idle speed as per bike manual up to 50-60 km then u may try to high rpm......After all I found a big differences which are very silence smoothness pickup & very reliable like new engine also increased the fuel economy....Hope u guys must try, am totally happy with this small bottle (3M Engine Oil Flush) & yes I used Motul 7100 20-50W 100% synthetic oil (1.5L) for my CBR 250R ABS.... 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	great product	2018-08-11	India	12	   every bike lover must try 3M 2wh Engine Oil Flush. it actually works. i am totally satisfied with the product.it perfectly worked as expected. Always use good engine oil for your bike i use Shell Engine oil.i first time used 3M 2wh Engine Oil Flush and i feel a huge change in the over all performance of my bike.Good Product 3M  5 Star rating. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	3	Not very helpful	2018-10-16	India	11	   I received package which had other shaped bottle than the photograph. Used it for first time on my CBZ 150 (34k km), and did not find much of a difference. Found some sludge when old oil was removed, but that's it. The engine ran buttery smooth and no noises only for 1 day, but that might also be due to new oil. Next day the noise was back.So did not find it making much of a difference. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	It works......!	2018-12-01	India	8	   I tried it in my Hero Galmour PGMFI. During sale I got it for 100₹ I was little Skeptical about this product but I had taken a chance I am happy after result. Result is positive in my case. Engine feels smooth now reduced some vibration.I have not seen any change. I suggested it to my brother also he tried and got results. Actual product and product image is different but i Don't care I am satisfied with the product. I have ordered is for my next oil change this is my 3rd purchase. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Too Good, go for it.	2018-12-20	India	5	   Have got two nos and usage are as below.1. Used this on my 15 year old PULSAR 150 (Non DTSI) 60K Kms for the first time. Looks genuine with latest packing, Poured all 50 ml to the engine oil and run engine for 10 mins on idle, 10 min with acceleration. On drain i could a very thin black oil coming out and is hot....Seems flush really done it's job. Past flush, used Shell Semi Synthetic 10W-40 Oil and i could see a huge difference, the acceleration, softness, beat and throttle response.2. Same case with my 10 years old Suzuki access 125 70K Kms. Past flush and adding Shell Semi Synthetic 10W-40 Oil, we could see the engine performance was too good and smooth, feel like its flying comparing to the previous state i.e. before oil flush/ change.Overall I am truly happy with this product and hats off to amazon for its quick and prompt delivery. Certainly will recommend. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	3	Good , detailed information below	2019-12-13	India	4	   14 months old stock was sent. That too Amazon fulfilled. Better prepare yourself before buying at low price. I have used the flush in Activa 2010 model, where I poured motul 10w30 oil earlier. One can feel the difference, if they were using mineral oil for a long time. Now I have moved to semi synthetic oil from motul, and the engine revs are smooth, and feeling better ride. It's better to use only 10w30 or 10w40 with jado mb or ma2 grade in gearless scooters. For activa, one may need 800 ml oil. And for gear oil use the higher grade 80w90. Please don't use engine oil for gear oil. Overall,Use the engine oil for less than 3000 Kms, if you ride with in the speed range of 40-50 Km.Gear oil can be changed along with engine oil. But use only 80w90 for gear oil.Air filter should be changed once it crossed 10000 Kms, and in between it should be cleaned for better mileage.Change the drive belt once in 25000 kms.Ask the mechanic to do clean the clutch during every service. This avoids handle vibration in gearless scooters.Have a lovely ride. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	Does its work well.	2019-02-10	India	3	   Its a flush which removes sludge and carbon deposits from the engine valves and other parts and cleans the engine parts upto a certain level.Easy and convenient to use.Does its work well.Engine stress reduces using this as i used it at 35k kms for the first time, it showed a significant result and the engine noice was reduced and was free running.Dont show hurry while using this give it a 10 min run inside the engine and drain till last drop. Dont rush to put new oil. Just let it come all the way out.Go for it it will not damage engine at all.But it will bring out the actual condition of your engine. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	2	I think this is no need for good condition bikes, or oil switchings..	2020-02-04	India	2	   I'm used this oil flush for my 1 yr pulsar rs 200, and my bike has no engine issues, but I'm used because of switching engine oil from mineral oil (stock Bajaj oil) to fully synthetic oil (motul 7100) but after some days my rs's engine begin starting oil leaks, and that needed to reinstall new oil seals and gaskets for no reason (because of flushing i think), but I've learnt somewhere there is no need to flush the engine because of switching oils so, I'll definitely recommend not to flush the engine pls do it only if the dirt or garbage is inside the engine... 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	1	Bad product,  my scooter engine oil leaking due to this product	2020-08-16	India	4	   After using this product on my Honda Aviator 2013 model,  engine oil leaking from head gasket,  shaft seal leaking, and also now small amount of white smoke coming from silencer.Please don't use this product on your vehicle.........

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Worked great!!	2019-05-23	India	2	   Got this for 123/- on sale but you'll usually find the price hovering in the 160s. This thing worked wonders for my Hero Maestro 2014 edition. Unlike a lot of people who've commented, I didn't trust my messed up old oil because it was time for changing it anyway.. so poured new Castrol Scooter mobil in along with this. Drove the scooter at will for 40-45 kms.. drained the oil entirely which had turned brownish within 40kms itself.. and then poured new Castrol Scooter mobil again and boy I could feel the changes. From pickup, gear shifting to starting kicks.. all works way better now. Its like my scooter got an adrenaline shot. Truly delighted !! 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	Great for cleaning.	2019-05-19	India	One	   this helps you remove sludge build up from your engine very easily. all u hve to do us add this before changing your oil and let your engine run for 10 minutes change gear and let it mix inside evenly.this helps remove sludge by thinning the oil so dont over run the engine.but it works wonderfully. easily removes sludge and helps clean engine from inside. and maintain its life.would definitely recommend this. also i advise to change oil filter whenever u use this one to ensure proper cleaning. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	Must use for every engine oil change.	2019-07-23	India		   his is the first time I am using engine flush. I do small jobs myself rather than giving it to a mechanic.

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	Wow!!!Didn't expect That!	2018-05-29	India	4	   I poured the 3M oil in my bike Engine and After Draining I feel the bike engine like New while Riding my Bike. Difference feels it Performance improved and I saw my old Engine oil was bit sticky and thinner. It was awesome experience. I'll buy it again soon. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Very Good	2019-01-27	India	2	   Bought it for 110 rupees on amazon sale.Very good product.Oil removed with it is very sludgy. It shows that it actually removed the sludge from engine. One suggestion. Pour this bottle in old oil when engine is too hot. And then run the engine for around 10 minutes. Then remove all oil. Than add new engine oil.For 1 litre of old engine oil in bikes  you require 50ml of engine flush oil. For cars you require 150 ml of flush if engine oil is 3 litres. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	It does it work of making the oil less viscous	2018-11-07	India	2	   I put all 50 ml in my pulsar 180 which is 8 years old. Well the old engine oil was shell advance ax 7 which had been used for 3000km. When I drained the oil it was dark coffee in color and very less viscous. So I can say that the flush had worked in decreasing the viscosity of old oil. But whether it did the work of flushing or not I can't say as I didn't feel any big difference. Now after changing the old engine oil I am using shell advance ultra and did a general servicing of bike. Bike running a little smooth. I don't know that is because of servicing or flushing.All I can say with full confident is this engine flush will decrease the viscosity of your old engine. But whether it will work or not that depends on many other factors such as how old is your engine, in what condition is your engine, etc etc 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Do it proper.	2019-06-28	India	2	   Firstly, u don't need to flush ur engine everytime you change oil. Just do it once in a year or couple of years. Flushing doesnt actually change anything much. It was satisfactory though. And you gotta pour it into the existing oil in the engine, idle the engine for 15 mins, then drain the oil. DON'T POUR IT IN ENGINE AFTER DRAINING THE OIL.

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Does the job very well	2018-10-24	India	One	   This is the first time I had used this, since I was not aware about it earlier. It works flawless and cleans up the engine very well, a significant difference,  I recently repaired my bikes engine with new parts and due to kick issue I had to open the casing couple to times, after I used 3M engine clean and when I opened the casing the Engine was very clean, all the old oil was drained out very well without any sticking to the parts. A very good Product. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	Don't use it if u change ur engine oil frequently!	2019-07-28	India	One	   If u frequently change ur engine oil (@2000-2500 km intervals)  and  use a good quality engine oil (mainly semi / fully synthetic) then u don't need to buy this..!I have used it in my shine after completing  20000 km, after draining the flushed oil i found no sludge particles that's mainly coz i frequently change the engine oil!Use flush only when u use a mineral oil / if u don't change ur engine oil frequently! And if ur engine has clocked over 40000-45000 then u can use this! 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Excellent Engine Flush	2019-06-25	India	One	   I used this 3M Flush in my Suzuki Swish 125 at 30000 Kms.

Guess this is a mild flush compared to liquimoly etc. So may be used in an old engine. Price could have been a wee bit cheaper. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	Don't use Simply	2020-06-25	India		   Use this only after 20k Kms, pour this to used oil and go for small ride and don't just accelerate in a Idle position. For better results go for a Small bumpy Ride. Then drain it well. Give extra time to drain. Then must Replace your Oil filter for better results. And don't use randomly thinking that you can clean everything in your engine, strongly recommend for oil filter-less bike, changing oil after using for More Kilometres or any other engine problems

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Effective Cleaning Agent for Engine.	2018-07-26	India	4	   This is first time I used any engine oil flush for my bike. Since this item was available at Rs 95/- (additionally 10% discount on HDFC card) during Prime Day Sale, so I thought to buy this oil and give a try before using new oil.Below is my experience on using this flush oil on my 8 year old Honda Unicorn clocked 56000KM. First time I used any flush.- As per recommendation use this oil for 15-20 mins in idle engine running condition. Since I was worried for any harmful effect I ran the engine for 10 mins.- Upon draining old oil, black sluggish deposits also came. Generally while draining old oil those deposits also came but what so special of this flush oil?- Well after changing the engine oil and driving bike for 10 days (~200KM), I can assure this flush oil really worked. Engine smoothness while driving, performance, engine noiseless really improved. I used Motul 4T 5100 10W30 Engine oil.- Definitely it remove the deposits from engine parts more than without using flush. Its an effective cleaning agents.- 3M mentioned this we can use it on every oil change, hope it wont do damages on every oil change.

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	3	Average product.	2018-08-24	India	4	   Received on time. But packing different from shown in listing. I took sample of oil from my aviator before adding flush oil. After adding engine flush oil I run my scooter for 6 kms. Then I changed the oil. But Honestly I did not find any difference in the sample I took before change and the after change oil. I also did not find any difference in my engine performance. So I don't know how far it is good for the engine.

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Clean Engine Healthy Engine	2018-04-24	India	2	   This is a 2 wheeler product. I used to use Abro or Wynns mekuba brands but this one is also good. No problems on the flush. Use this additive with the oil before every oil change. If not at least every alternate oil change to keep ur engine healthy and happy.If it's a new bike my recommendation oil flush every 6 months. Change ur oil ever 3 months irrespective u use it or no. U take care of ur bike, ur bike will take care of you.

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	Regular Oil Change? Then No Need For It.	2018-08-18	India		   It's a nice product for bikes which don't get oil replaced within the stipulated oil change interval. If you keep changing your bike's oil 1000km before the original change limit then I bet you won't need this product.I used this product and ran the engine idle for 20 minutes with regular throttle given at time intervals. I then drained the oil and I saw that only came out and there was no sludge at all just like always.Because I regularly change my bike's oil 1000km before change limit. So this habit of mine won't let sludge buildup in the engine and engine remains clean from inside.And I used this only once on an 8 year old bike 32000 km done. So, I think I won't require it on every oil change.Engine is little smoother now with motul 10w30 900 ml. Like my review if you find it useful. 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	Tried this for first time. Worked on first go!	2018-06-08	India	3	   Works!! My bike (yamaha FZ 16) engine oil was dark red before adding.

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	Different from what it looked on the pictures	2018-06-20	India	One	   The packaging was really good but one thing that's bothering me is that the oil flush came with a different design bottle which I couldn't find like this even searching for hours in Google,the branding, price and everything is same but the design and shape of the bottle is different from what I used to order and use earlier. So I'm still in confusion to use it or not.

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	5	MUST FOR ENGINE OIL CHANGE .	2018-07-16	India		   I think every oil company should recommend this . The flush removes each and every drop of old oil from the engine. Though some oil like 30-50ml still remains in the engine . This flush helps to remove those remaining oils stuck and prepares engine for the new oil .Highly recommended for performance and mileage users .I coupled this with MOTUL 7100 for better performance .

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	iys good for engine but my timming chain is making noise	2018-04-09	India		   See i have fz16, 2009model.I used this product, iys good for engine but my timming chain is making noise, very little but yes its making noise after this product.I will fix it from yamaha authorised service.Rest easy to start and smooth may be bcz of new egine oil.Recommend to use before you change engine oil grade 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	Absoultely working	2018-06-10	India	2	   Definitely works and removed almost 60-70% of emery from my pulsar 180 - 2010 model, which i grudgingly admit is getting old.Though best way is to go to a mechanic and get the centrifugal oil filter cleaned physically, but this is a good alternative to that.Though you need to clear the new oil once again in lesser time.I checked the old oil coming out of engine and noticed lots of emery of minute to 2mm size in oil which normally never comes with old oil, so the product does works !! 
3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	3	Its better to use petrol or diesel to clean the engine ...	2018-02-06	India	2	   Didn't made any difference. Its better to use petrol or diesel to clean the engine rather than using such a costlier product.After using this product i didn't find any difference in smoothness, performance or vibrations in the engine. Havn't checked the mileage yet but i don't think that it will made any difference on mileage either.I think these type of products are a waste of money.

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	1	Not useful	2018-09-27	India		   I did not buy it from Amazon. But I am sure I got a genuine product off the stores. I used it by following each and every instruction religiously. I have used it on my Avenger 220 which is 3 years old. Didn't find any difference. Engine felt actually harsher after using this. I would not recommend this to anyone. Overall I feel engine flush is unnecessary and useless.

3M_2wh_Engine_Oil_Flush_(50_ml)	4	Too expensive	2017-05-19	India	28	   I used 3m engine oil flush on my pulsar 150 ug 2 model. I didn't find much difference after using it as we all know the harshness of pulsar engine for decade. Regarding to price, I bought the same product at 295 rupees last September. Now the price is 550 rupees. It's not fair. When I check price tag there is no price is written. Check urself. It's too costly for 50 ml engine flush. U can check some pictures I uploaded here. you can get it more cheaper on other shopping sites like ebay, flipkart and snap deal.
