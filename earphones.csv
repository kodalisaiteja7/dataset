But after continuos research of 3-4 days I decide to go with CX 180.When this product arrived, I first checked for the Originality of it. Thanks to Amazon Service, I found that Product was Original.Pros:-Balanced Sound Quality.-Light Weight Plugs.-Matte Finish helps the earphone look fresh and new for a long time.-This is not an angled earphone, so if you are a person like me who often breaks earphones. Do not worry, this comes out very easily with little force, so whenever you are likely to break this earphone by mistake, this earphones will come out and save you some money.cons:- Tangles.Thank You.",641 people found this helpful,4
Shrinath V,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great pair of earphones,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y7HCEXEA9VHL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D75AB6I,Reviewed in India on 16 January 2019,Style name: CX 275s,https://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-CX-180-Street-II/product-reviews/B008V6T1IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_fmt?ie=UTF8&formatType=current_format,Verified Purchase,"I usually don't write reviews, but I've bought two of these and haven't been disappointed.The sound quality is good, but for me, the best feature no one seems to talk about is the mic. I take a lot of calls, and though this doesn't have noise cancellation, it works very well for making calls in noisy environments. I rarely get complaints that others are not able to hear me or of traffic noise disrupting calls (a perennial problem in India). I'm able to take conference calls when travelling, which is a huge plus. The build quality is good. There is a problem that the wire connecting the audio input is weak and tends to break if not stored carefully. I've had that problem once, but Sennheiser replaced this without question. I've started storing the pair in the pouch they supply and have not had issues later.The pouch really keeps things secure. A couple of days ago, I forgot to take it out of my shirt before putting it into the washing machine. I later realized this and picked it from the shirt pocket after the washing cycle, dried the pair and found that it worked as usual - a huge relief.I'm not a huge audiophile and don't wax eloquent on basss/treble reproduction and the like, but for me, this is a great pair for my use cases - good music playback, great service and ability to make calls on the street. I find very few reviews focussing on these, so wanted to highlight these for prospective buyers.",454 people found this helpful,6

The company is generous enough to handle service in these situations. Warranty can be claimed remotely just by sending your damaged/defective products through courier to any of the service centres mentioned in the warranty information and the replacement is done within a short span of time(Not more than just 7 days.).

Initially, I found the tiny pinch holds on the eaebuds difficult to let them be inserted easily and quickly into ears. But with some practice that problem has receded.

The wire length got reduced drastically after the wire twisted from several places.

One of the earpieces stopped working 5 months after purchase. But a big THANKS to the best after sales support of Sennheiser, the product was replaced in 5 minutes with no questions asked!Kudos to Sennheiser to have such a customer friendly attitude and have such warranty policies which are actually there to help customers and not bog them down with questions and procedures.I will buy Sennheiser again despite this product being average given its cost because I am not afraid that my product might be faulty or develop a fault.Verdict - Buy this product for the decent sound with a great mic and the promise of Sennheiser.

These are 6dB louder than the sonys. But while listening, it feels like I am listening to 96kbps mp3s. There is also a certain graininess (must be some distortion) in voices that is totally absent from the Sony.Headphone emphasizes tones around 100Hz and 4kHz. But at the cost of real treble, lower mids and subbass. Unlike Sony, bass here is about quantity and not quality. It is loose, distorted and does not go as low. Granted, all cheap earphones cut sharply above 15kHz, but I was expecting some sparkle in 6-10kHz range; even that is missing here, making the sound signature extremely lo-fi.Comfort is much inferior to Sony and Panasonic ones due to large diameter drivers used in this product. If only they were any good apart from increased sensitivity! Stay away unless you are middle aged/old person with age related hearing loss.",9 people found this helpful,0

I really love the sound quality of these headphones, it is full with equal emphasis on the lows, mids and highs without any artificial bass boosting. You get a flat sound which makes this pair really versatile. It is great for movie watching and voice calls. The mic is great. Everyone I called using this pair said I sounded clear with no distortions. Also these come with 2 years warranty which is very nice to have.Now let's get to the cons, and as usual its the built quality. The wires are thin and made up of flimsy looking rubber. I have seen braided cables in headphones much cheaper than this. I would have loved Sennheiser to at least give some quality materials, because you have to really take care or else I feel the wires will break. Also the mic button feels cheap.Overall, this is a great pair of headphones for anyone looking for rich and clear sound.

Quality of sound on call is very good and I majorly only use them for attending calls and watching videos on YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime. They work pretty well for the purpose.Cons:I use a Nokia 8 and these headphones give a constant buzzing noise in calls while the other person on call talks. The little connecter is even worse.

This one is no exception.It's not really for bass heads, if that's what you're looking for. This will instead give you a well balanced, realistic sound. Noise cancellation is as good as the choice of earbud you put on. I generally do not care much about noise cancellation and will compromise on it for feeling non-claustrophobic, so I put the smallest earbuds on mine instead.Decent choice, and I got this at a rather affordable rate because of a sale. Only issue is the build quality, because the wires on this one are really quite flimsy and will know rather easily as well.The best part of buying Sennheiser though, is the customer service. You could honestly, basically break the thing, call Sennheiser service centre, go there, and they'll almost in no time give you a replacement product with no hassle.I've often broken my headphones twice and gotten them replaced without a cinch. It's the best reason really to buy a Sennheiser. They never skimp on customer service.",2 people found this helpful,0

I also have a CX-275 S and also CX-180. I've lost my CX-275 S while shifting of house so bought a CX-300 ii.These are quite impressive of a earphones from Sennhesier newest addition of CX family.ProsSound- Well when you buy earphones.. first you should do is put them in a burn in session. Burn in is like exercising of audio headsets. We do that so as to loose the diaphragm of headphone and to stress the headphone driver. We have to do at least 40 hours of burn in time for a headphone or earphone to achive its potential.  I've still gotta 30 hours worth of burn in but I've did a burn in of 6 hours as I've bought it since yesterday. Truth to be told.. when i heard it before burn in.. right out of package.. the sound is too trebly with sharp highs & no adequate bass whatsoever. After 6 hrs of burn in.. the earphones sound much cleaner, with pleasant mids & balanced highs & well enough thump of bass. Its as good as CX 180 i have but isn't as accurate in instrument seperation or sound stage as my CX 300 ii. So its a very well performed earphones for someone who prefers clarity.In earphone mic: Pretty good enough. No disturbance in hearing & recieving voices from my end & to the other person who's talking as well. It just does the job.ConsSound: i think the 6 hr burn in did do good.. but i can't help but listen that even at full volume.. the earphones isn't loud enough. Even less loud than CX-180 ii. Thats strange cause CX 180 costs less than this yet the loudness in CX-180 is superior even at 80% of volume.  I'll do more burn in of 30 hours to see if there'll be any change in loudness so that i can update this review again.Cable- The cable noise in this is too much than even in both CX-180 ii & CX- 300 ii of mine. This is particularly annoying when you're listening to your music while walking. Especially at calls too some of the voice gets muddled due to wind movement as well. The cable noise is a bit too much.So overall a good enough earphones which most music lovers can be pretty happy about than most of the generic sound signature brands. These are clear sounding & much more pronounced than others you can find if sound quality & clearness is paramount to you.Edit: After 30 hours of burn in.. yep this sound signature is more nuanced now. Much better with more rounded bass that kicks in when needed with more oomph. And also mids & highs are much more balanced & hits the right chord. Its just really good. And also loudness improved.Just go for it👍🏻",3 people found this helpful,0

And before I leave, let me also slip in that there's no mic for calls. So the one purpose for which this thing was made, and that's a guess - music, it doesn't even do that right.

Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●COMFORT :------------● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●LOUDNESS :-------------CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :---------------------------------------------I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :----------------------------------● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :PNOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●CUSTOMER CARE :--------------------● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●CONNECTIVITY :------------------All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.VERDICT :----------I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",One person found this helpful,0

My primary observation its very much on the bass centric , volume at 70 percent is absolutely good for bass lovers. Low and mids has some problems few light vocals go miss and sound gets muffled. As per some techies they said burn in for few hours releases the full potential which i did for almost 80 hours. Now i find it good . Definitely i would recommend to buy under the budget class. On the negative aspect the wire used is very cheap and it gets tangled a lot and you also fear if its gonna break so delicate. earphones fit into very nicely but its totally plastic build. if you can waive of these few exceptions you will definitely enjoy the rest.

The headset has a plastic and rubber build. The cable is prone to tangling and also a little on the thin side. Durability can be an issue as a result, so if your earphones get rough treatment this is probably not the model for you.Sound qualityThe company state the earphones have bass-driven stereo sound, which is accurate. They are more on the balanced side than some of the other earphones in the CX line, although the bass definitely has a bit of a boost. The midrange is clear and the treble is fairly pleasant. They aren’t audiophile quality earphones but they perform respectably for the price-point. The microphone also performs well during calls.ConclusionThe Sennheiser CX 275S isn’t a terrible product although it does fall down in several areas. Sennheiser got the audio and microphone set-up right. However the headset is not very durable and the lack of volume controls on the remote definitely bring it down a peg or two.The Sennheiser CX 275S offers good audio performance, although it has a fragile build and does not include volume controls.",One person found this helpful,0

It works fine so far and the only reason I've given it a 3 star rating is because Amazon has delivered it on time and given me an original product.However, I'm disappointed in sennheiser. The sound quality isn't that great for the price range. I feel skullcandy, jbl and JVC were better brands I've used. They were all cheaper than this one too.The wire is extremely thin. I've seen thicker woolen strings to be honest. The manufacturing charges of this product might be about 2$ and they've charged the consumer about 11$.The plastic is feeble, the insulation is thin and I'm pretty sure the cable inside won't be too great because if they have used cheap materials for the outside, I can only imagine how bad the parts that the consumer cannot see might be.That being said, it is original and I've checked with the registration number on the pack.This pair has lovely noise cancelling and is good for film sound effects; average for music and I don't really listen to R&B but if you do, be warned the bass is below average.If you need a pair for travel music then a single tug on the public transport would probably ruin the wire.",One person found this helpful,0

Such was the quality of the latter, that i decided to go with Sennheiser.My first impression was that, the connecting wires were very thin and looked like they could break easily.Also, you don't get an L-jack with this. This becomes a problem when the wire near the jack stays always bent when connected, which might lead to future loose connections.Regarding sound quality:Overall volume is higher than MX 170. This increase in volume is acheived by increasing the treble portion of the sound spectrum, so you can hear higher frequency sounds easily. Human voices sound crystal clear and so crisp that I can even hear the breathe of singers' in songs. Excellent for having online audio conferences, and you can hear what others say very clearly. But the downside of having such a high treble is that high pitched voices sound louder, especially when female voices start appearing, you feel as if the volume has increased suddenly. Cymbals in music also sound amplified.So, by no means it is a balanced sound profile. Bass is much lesser than treble, and those portions of music with just bass beats sounds damped. In an effort to increase the bass, when you increase the volume, treble also gets increased accordingly, and once your speaker volume goes above 60 % or so, your ear starts to hurt because of high pitches being loud.Microphone clarity is just acceptable.In a nutshell, this product is made for music with lots of treble content, human speech and is good for such music or attending phone calls and online meetings, but not having a balanced sound profile, punchy music can't be enjoyed.Because of the lack of bass, I am forced to return this product in exchange for refurbished Sony xb55ap which is 300₹ less.",One person found this helpful,0

No microphone & in-line remote.Overall Opinion:The Sennheiser CX180 is an in-ear canalphone-style headset, and has a frequency response range of 20-20,000Hz. It also has an impedance rating of 16Ohms and a sensitivity of 110dB. The headset does not have an in-line microphone and remote, and has a standard 1.2m cable. The sales package includes three sets of ear-tips in different sizes.On the design front, the Sennheiser CX180 is simple and functional. Made entirely of plastic, the earphones have a glossy finish on the front and a dull finish on the back, which has been designed in such a way that it's possible to grip each earphone between your finger and thumb for insertion and removal. It's also incredibly light and comfortable, which ensures ease of use over long periods. The only flaw is the cable, which is thin, tangle-prone, and extremely susceptible to cable noise. There is a clear boost in the bass, and this is done to appease the majority of buyers in this price range who look for bass and attack. The vibrations from the bass can definitely be felt, without getting excessive.Finally, with State Of The Art, based on the soundstaging and vocal quality of the CX180. There is no soundstaging to speak of, with the sound appearing two dimensional and simplified. Where better headphones succeed in creating an image in your head, the CX180 has you feeling as though the sound is originating from a single location, or at best a narrow zone. Vocals don't quite have as much power, but are certainly able to work themselves over the boosted bass.",2 people found this helpful,0

I've had another branded earphone from Jabra that didn't even last 4 months. Coming to the most important part of these headphones. Sound. I'm someone who listens to songs with beats and some unplugged songs. Both sound great. Bass is excellent but not the best. None of the other instruments or vocals are distorted, no matter how heavy the bass is. Mic works very well too. To conclude, of you're looking for a branded, good sounding and durable headphone Cx275s will not disappoint.

(Trebles are slightly boosted, so is the case with CX180, But better than cx 180 for sure)The noise isolation is also awesome,as the eartips completely blocks outside noise, I usally wear them in mumbai locals and after wearing I cannot hear the train moving or sound of train tracks, people etc. So with you might listen sounds loudly with normal volume.The cable quality is also good except for the jack. With earphones(in box) though you are provided with an extra ""L"" shaped Jack but for me the ""L"" shaped didn't work with my mobile and I had my original cable broken from the side of jack.Overall if you are a rough user, you may once think over buying them.

Treble felt dominant too . It may be annoying for few types of songs.If you have cx180 no need to switch unless mic or music control functions are required.Tested with my smartphone and FiiO X3ii .Declaration: Don't expect  heavy bass in either cx180 or cx275s like Sony XB series; which are having significant recessed vocals.Also as per own preference needed to lower high frequencies via equaliser for making bass more enjoyable ; this will control excessive treble(brightness) too .I have Rs 700/ Creative EP-630(using 3rd pair since 2010) too. It has better  sound signature than Sennheiser Cx275s. EP-630 had gained immense popularity in past.I have natural uncoloured sounding  AKG K240-mkii, Hifiman RE400a(similar priced) .

Much better than cs275s.

It was an impulsive purchase, i had absolutely no idea that these are one of the best earphones in the market. Unfortunately after a rigorous usage, they had a small issue. I wasn't keeping them properly and lost interest after a little while.Got them at a good price from Amazon. Love the quality. I have also used We Cool Bluetooth earphones and figured out i don't need those. The charging and all that is a bit of a hassle.  The CX 180 is simply amazing. I cannot go into the details because i am no expert here but the quality speaks for itself. Once you get accustomed to a cozy seat in lets say a Maybach or Rolls Royce, you won't feel as comfortable in a Honda Accord. Its the same way with Sennheiser CX 180. Once you use them, you'll start missing them when you downgrade. Audio is superb, everything is crisp and clear. I keep my phone at 70% volume and it's still loud enough. Bass is very good, does not crack, its punchy and sweet. Everything is so well balanced, there's nothing more one could ask for. They are also lightweight and look quite sober.I am retaining the We Cool earphones pad for my CX180. I have also seen few videos as to how to keep these in mint condition. Keep them safe, use them properly and these won't disappoint you at all.",,0

Extremely clear and natural audio and the most comfortable in ear headphones that I have used so far.In this price range, I will definitely recommend these if mic is not essential. With mic, you can go for the realme buds 2. Lastly, there is always the jbl c100si, c150si ( all same sound quality ).Build quality is okayish here. I had not expected realme buds 2 to excel but they do. The wires are really thin here. I bought this only for the hype they get and to be honest, these are actually so good in terms of sound and sound only. Sennheiser has a 2 yr warranty so no complaints.Bass is more punchy in the realme buds 2, highs are also good there. But the cx 180 offers a more natural and balanced output where you miss nothing. Nothing is over emphasized here. See, I am bringing the realme buds 2 again because they exceed expectations even though they are not as experienced in this field as the Sennheiser.But here is the thing. I feel more comfortable with the cx 180. The ear buds are small, the ear tips are perfect, the sound stage is brilliant, the highs feel more alive, the bass kicks in where needed, the vocals are super clear too. These headphones do justify the good reviews here. But if you need a mic and a better build quality with a minor compromise in terms of the overall sound signature, then you know which ones I would recommend. Nothing against JBL, but they do not last more than 8 months.Update: Within 5 months, the wires have started to crack. Still the best sounding earphones but the wires are too bad.",,0

However, if you are looking for extra bass then perhaps these may not be where you should be looking at.They are quite comfortable for regular use and the noise-cancellation is quite good at this price point.

The seller Cloudtail delivered it timely. I researched a lot about earphones before buying and fixed onto this. The Sony earphones with extra bass are quite expensive, the Skullcandy ones do not last long and so  Sennheiser being a reputed brand I took this. This is the best-selling earphone under Rs. 1000. I will now discuss what I liked about this:1. Sound quality - First and foremost, the sound quality is amazing. It’s very crisp and bass is ok too. The highs and mids are clear and can hear every beat. With proper equalizer this can be a beast. Anyways, the lows can be managed as they can’t be crystal clear on an expensive one too.2.Comfort - The earphone looks to be durable and last for a long time. Yes, the wire is thin but coming from a well established brand it will not wear easily.3. Packaging - The box was well packed and you will find the earphones along with changeable earbuds. The box may not be as stylish like that of the Sony ones but quite decently it is packed.4. Price - Under Rs. 1000 it’s a deal because you get a complete package with good branded earphones and crisp sound that will shake your soul. If you are bass-head then you can go for Sony MDR-XB30EX else this one’s perfect for you. Overall, I am loving music on this earphone and been over 3 months with no issues.",,0

Also they're so tiny that you can comfortably put them under your helmet and I love the ear tips. They're soft.This is my 7th purchase of CX180. That's how much I like them.

Sound is equivalent to both the ears and left side has no equivalent sound, mic is not there ..it lacks durability too just because wires are not for rough it require special care, overall quality could have improved but don't go with the brand, always prefer brilliant audio tuning rather than brand.This is short brief and this may vary later as per the experience is concerned",,0

ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY. WOULDN'T PAY 200 FOR THESE. Also please keep in mind that this  frustration is coming from a guy who was already happy with his boat 152.There is no mic on this as well. I feel so sad right now that I wasted 730rs on these. Boat 152 has some great bass and it has great volume at 500rsNow some people will argue that I am a ""basshead"" and that I have no taste in ""real music"" ....please stop. I was using Mi basics and when I switched to boat 152...it felt like a whole new world of music. I could hear every single frequency range properly and loudly. Now these Sennheisers feel like a step back from that.The high frequencies are tooooo HIGH it hurts my ears when I raise the volume over 60%. The bass is fine but not anywhere near as boats.Just buy the boat 152s guys..You can tinker around with the settings of the equaliser and you'll be good to go.Don't believe people who'll say that you'll experience a ""whole new world of music"" with Sennheiser and other premium headphones ....it's all B.S.Buy the cheaper ones...that's enough for most of us.I'm a ""zero Fs given"" kinda guy.

As it doesn’t have any noise isolation but still if it perfectly fit in ears the sound is least effect with considerable noise. That is, it’s great for general commute. Its mike is also great with it position and recording quality makes it best for calling.Although it’s not a deal breaker but like me do not expect much with l shaped extension adapter it only works with Samsung or some selected device. And it is also mention on its cover.Comparing it with Sony MDR series (extra bass series) Schneider headphone is way ahead in sound quality, although it depends on your taste but it like Sony MDR series have special punch to bass slightly cutting other aspects like tone quality and treble. Schneider (This model) have almost the same (or better bass) with even better quality of other sound, other than sound it’s also have superior in comfort and ergonomics.The only thing it lag is the build quality, in almost same price tag Sony MDR series are IP68 and build to last till you are bored with it. While this headphone needs to be treated like a baby and the other trade off with Schneider is lesser service centre in India.So, if you are planning for workout or training music then forget this try Schneider’s higher sports model or try Sony, Skullcandy etc. but if you are music lover looking only for premium sound quality then it’s the best in this price range.",One person found this helpful,0

I use those only for music on the go. I wanted a second cheaper pair for videos and pillow streaming. I had xiaomi basic. They were cool but I was never satisfied with them. Within 6 months they developed problems with the connector.So I ordered these cx 180. I wasn't sure whether I could trust them or not. But as soon as I got them, I plugged them in and boy oh boy, I was amazed. They are meant for people who love bass heavy music. They are light and comfortable in ear. Sleeping them in your ear doesn't pose any problems and you can use them inside helmets too because the module is small, and it won't put a lot of pressure inside your ear.They aren't obviously as clear as cx 275s but for the price point they perform better than xiaomi basic, boat nirvana and even jbl. I personally prefer them over Sony xb55ap, because they are too bulky and the bass dampens the treble too much.Those who have the tendency for rough handling should go for cx 180 because they feel much durable than cx 275s. Cx 180 also gets an angled connector which is much better inside pockets.In my opinion, once one falls in love with SENHEISER, they'll never go back to Sony or jbl for no reason.I am ENTERTAINED.  (I'll add a detailed sound review after its burn in period and at least after 6 months.)Ps : buy a good paid equaliser like power amp and get used to it. One of the best deciding of my life.

Easy to rest the phone on my tummy or table 😬Cons:Wires are very thin & tangle like crazy ☹️ They should provide something attached to tie the wires while storing. Something like Velcro what comes in boat sets.In the darkness you can’t make out which ear plug is left one or right one. Both are identically built.

The bass output is adequate, but not as heavy as the ones from Sony or Mi in this similar price point. So if you're a fan of the ""wub-wub"", then I would recommend you to avoid these earphones and go for one that accentuate bass more with larger driver.2. These earphone provides a very balanced audio profile out of the box, so if you want to experience the best out of this earphone you need to have a basic understanding of the audio settings and Equalizersnof your phone. Or else you will end up having a mediocre experience out of these great earphones. That being said, this applies on pretty much any earphones TBH.3.the build quality of this earphones are a huge problem. The wires are flimsy and rubbery. Forget about braiding , they don't even come with a earphone pouch or bag l. So be ready to spend a few more bucks to buy a pouch, and protective silicone cover for these earphones if you want a  few good years of use out of them.4. It has a microphone and call button that has a decent sound quality. But do not expect anything extra out of those mic.5. Thankfully the 3.5mm jack is gold plated but it is not a right angle jack so be mindful while using it. Straight jacks gets broken pretty easily compared to right angle ones.That's all folks",,0

I have handled them with all the care, never dropped, kept cleaned, no wires pulled.I am not a rough user, I have used my Galaxy Note 4 inside box Earphone for 5 years with lesser care than that with the CX 180.===> Very important to know, the noise attenuating ability (says Sennheiser, perfect ear canal fit) creates a pressure on the eardrum, which causes pain, gives headaches and will damage the eardrum for sure. You can feel that right after putting them on.The Samsung earphones used to let out the air between the eardrum and the earphone. They were not painful at all, I have used them 8-10 hours a day playing video games and enjoying music.Bass quality was not that good as at high volume it is more painful.Sound quality is good (I enjoyed my collection of 80s international). You can hear enemies from a long distance in the video games. Believe me with all the experience as I have a collection of music from 320kbps to 2300kbps but nothing matters if the earphones are harmful to your ears.One should always check the sample one in the store to make sure the earphones are made for their ears.For the price of ₹649 there are many alternatives, Samsung told me that the in-box earphone have an alternative, EHS64. There is Oppo O-fresh with Hi-res certification (lowest available for ₹699) which I would like to try and soon many will be available with Hi-res. You can spend more money for a Sony.

Sub bass is not promising but you cannot expect an earphone to have everything at this price. Mids are present and at par with what any other earphone has to offer under 1k. Vocals sound very natural and boasts of a great deal of clarity. The highs are very sparkling and crisp but however at loud volumes, they can get a little soaring and distorted (usually after 90% volume).

The audio quality is clear enough to enjoy the crisp details inside music.Calling - it is clear and audible and not too loud as well.Built quality & durability - One must remember electronics are sensitive and taken with care they last longer than expected. Cable is well insulated and sturdy in comparison with other brands. Buds are soft and fits well inside the ears, not to miss out other size buds available to suit one's size of ears to make sit comfortably.Controls - one button, multiple functions (instructions provided in the user manual).Warranty - 24months, do not miss out to be reminded off that if in case of any issues please do reach out the manufacturer for further details.Finally, one might be wondering why 4 stars? 1 star is reduced for the excess treble for which the only solution is to adjust with equalizer suitable to one's own taste.

You can feel the comparison yourself if you ever used headphone(not earphone) beforeout of function after  6 months so quality is also worst in this price range.If you can go for a higher range than don't buy cx180.

But coming from cx 180 i find the sound quality very similar, i repeat very very similar, ok, i get it, the signature Sennheiser sound will be same on both as they are from the same brand, i have tested it side by side with cx 180 for literally 2 days, and there is no significant sound quality difference. I think this is not acceptable, I'm spending my extra 900 bucks only for a very very minor sound quality upgrade and a microphone.So the bottom line is- if you have no money to waste and don't want microphone go for cx 180 closing the both eyes.

By that i mean that any other brand would give you this quality at anything around 700 to a thousand.Sound quality is something that senheiser has always maintained even in it's cheapest of products, but unfortunately not in this case. The sound quality is average and doesn't give the senheiser feel. Also no bass.Headphone aren't that comfortable and one can feel slight distress and pain if used for long hours. The design isn't ergonomic, but the noise cancellation is superb. That enhances the overall sound quality of the earphone.Cables are normal and so is the jack. The earphone comes with a spare angled jack which can be used as an adaptor. But using the adaptor jack has a drastic impact on the sound quality and the sound gets torned. So basically it's of no use.The strength of the wire is good. But the life span is yet to be tested.Overall it's an average earphone and doesn't deserve the price it demands. I would rather sugget you to go for hd earphones if you are willing to pay this range of price.",,0

I preferred them especially for the bud shape they have & I was pretty much confident that these earphones will  be perfectly suitable for my ears because it is all a matter of perfect fit in the ears to be able to experience that ""perfect bass and sound quality""(even mentioned on their packaging as well). I have boat 225 earphones since two years which also have similar shaped but slightly long earbuds due to which they were uncomfortable. I didn't realised it until I got them & instantly regretted. They are still performing great btw. (I pesonally, never liked other ""angled"" bud earphones). Also, for online study purposes, I needed some comfy earphones for long durations. I wishlisted Sennheiser CX 180 a while ago, but now I preferred the mic version i.e. CX 275s instead. Also, I heard that CX 180 has more treble than CX 275s & some positive reviews about sound quality added cherry on the cake. So, I have a constant watch on CX 275s for a good deal, & finally purchased them for ₹1599/-. It's only two days & I am already loving them & feeling quite addicted to them.Although they are fragile, they are in my extremely caring hands, & backed up by Sennheiser's 2 year warranty.And as always, thank you Amazon for your excellent services & offers.Cheers!!👍💐",,0

Used jbl c100si , boat 172, ant w56, cx 213 and currently using 180. Go for boat if you want just build and looks, else everything is crap. Jbls had good clarity but lil bass and no stereo effect. Ant has an explosive bass, highs are good and mids are okay. Cx 213 has lil extra bass than 180 but vocals are not as good as 180 due to bass. And also the bass in 180 was very soothing than 213, which tends to overpower other frequencies.Conclusion : if you just want bass with satisfactory vocals and highs and great build, go for ant w56.. Been 8 months and still going well.And if you want to enjoy every minute details in the music cx 180 has no match.I personally use ant w56 for mic and rough use and bass heavy music.

So when I was about to order soundmagic es18 again,  it was unavailable.  So I searched for another & sennheiser cx180 came through.Comparing sennheiser cx180 with Soundmagic es18, I felt :-1) Sound is not clear in sennheiser cx180. But in soundmagic, it's more clear.2)Bass is on the higher side in sennheiser cx180 eventhough i adjusted my phone equaliser to the minimum. Now I can't reduce the bass as it's on the lowest setting. But bass is ok for this budget. But the prob is its on the higher side. Some songs are irritating me as I can't reduce the bass.3) Treble is ok. Can be adjusted with the equaliser.4) wire quality is gud. I'm writing this review after 3 months use. So,  I hav no probs with the wire quality.So in short, I think soundmagic is better compared to sennheiser cx180.& I feel Sennheiser cx180 is overrated.",,0

I am gonna list the pros and cons of these for the sake of comprehension.PROS:1. Great design2. The tips provided with these are very soft and comfortable, so you don't get tired of these after long sessions.3. The sound quality is off the charts for the amount of price is paid.4. This is a very great balanced earphone. BASS and TREBLE are balanced efficiently so sounds are not muffled.5. A leather pouch is included in the box for carrying these babies.6. mic quality is very great too.7. The distortion of sound at high levels is surprisingly much less.8. They are much loud and the loudest levels don't lose clarity.9. An L-shaped adapter is provided in the box to use with smartphones and laptops.10. 2-years warranty and the service is very good.CONS:1. They are very sensitive. So you have to take care of them and not use them roughly or they will break.2. (only if you like BASS heavy music.) these aren't BASSHEADS so bass is balanced with treble, thus bass is not  heavy but it sounds better when it's not heavy.3. The connector at the end can break easily with rough usage so I advise you to use the L-shaped  connector/adapter provided in the case with smartphones and laptops(if you use it on your lap.)",,0

The ear-ins are soft and do not cause discomfort even though if you are using for a long duration.--> The Cable length is good. It's quite long.Overall, if you want to enjoy the balanced music, this is a perfect pick (ofcourse, without mic).Could have included, the carry case.

I still swear by the Sennheiser CX-180 Street II as the best value for money, but I needed earphones with a microphone for my commute. I've been using these for over 10 months now. Despite looking delicate, they are well built and my earphones have survived daily commutes in Mumbai locals and metro during rush hour (that's saying something) without any damage so far. The sound quality is very good for the price and the bass response is decent (doesn't sound muddy or overpowered). Unlike JBL earphones which I find sound faint even at full volume, I've never had to go over 70% volume with these earphones. They come with a small pouch which is handy. While I prefer the right-angled 3.5mm jack on the CX-180 Street II, the straight jack on these is going string and the wire hasn't broken or shown signs of tear so far. For a great sounding pair of earphones with mic that doesn't break the bank, look no further.",,0

I'll try to find some app that will let me map the volume buttons for play/pause/previous/next.The build quality leaves a lot to be desired, just taking them out of the packaging box felt terrifying because the wires were so tightly clamped, and the less said about material the better.And well, 699 is not cheap, at least it's not to me.Actually not that I see it, it has a lot of cons.But then again, if Sennheiser made perfect headphones that would never break, then no one would actualy buy their other more costly products, or buy the same earphones again, now will they?Huh, I guess that's why phones still aren't waterproof even though water repelling technology has progressed so much in the last few decades.",One person found this helpful,0

I was excited since this was my first time to use any Sennheiser product. They worked super fine on the starting weeks. But now in the month of june they just stopped working like they used to. sound quality dropped by leaps and bounds. I can't even hear properly what's the person is saying in any YouTube video. Have to put on captions.  They do give great costumer services but now in lockdown... Everything is changed.The nearest centre from my home is one in mumbai. It remains closed due to the pandemic. I tried calling the one in kolkata, they didn't picked any of my call.Pros :sound is too good. More sound when compared to other earphones in the similar price range.Noise cancellation is pretty good.L shaped lead. Love this design. Will help you avoiding wire break located close to the lead. Also it's comfortable when playing pubg or any other game. It doesn't hinders your finger movements.Cons :Built quality is okay. They say it's tangle free but it gets tangled easily.Keep in mind that there's no mic. I once attended an online meeting and they couldn't hear me properly.Ear comfort is problematic. You'll have to push earphones into your ears often since they fall out easily.Bass is low. Yes! I've been using jbl cs 100 which costs a little more than these but the output of them is super. The bass in these is low when compared to jbl.Conclusion : They do give 2 years warranty but you have to look properly. See! There are only 4 centres of Sennheiser so replacement can be a problem especially when you are stuck like me because of the lockdown. I'll suggest you to go with JBL. The warranty is one year but you'll be much more satisfied. This is the last time I'll be using these Sennheiser earphones. I won't recommend to any of my friends since my experience wasn't too good. No mic, less bass, poor quality, service centre problems, no response on call, made me to switch back to JBL again.Hope this will be helpful to you and you'll be able to make decision.Have a nice day!!✨",,0

But to my surprise, I found the trebles to be pretty high and sharp too. This sometimes becomes disturbing when there are ssss es in the vocals or the hithats are being struck.Plus, the product is under 10 days replacement now, meaning if you are dissatisfied, you can ask for a replacement and the same thing will be sent to you. You CANNOT exchange it for amazon pay balance or a refund in your bank a/c.The GOOD part which made me smile:The earpieces are really tiny and you can sleep ear down and it wont be a discomfort.

I already have a Sennheiser HD 202 II to use at home (The cord is over 2.00 Mtrs. in Length, hence its not that handy outside, but the quality is phenomenal.) and I snapped my long serving Skullcandy S2DUDZ-003 Headphones, I was looking out for new ones.DESIGN:The design of the earphones is brilliant with the way you ergonomically hold up the earphone and insert it in your ear-canal, each element has been worked upon and well design. The cord though long, seems fragile, I am concerned about this especially because I am person who will use it in a excessively rough manner. Will be able to comment on the same after some months of rough use.SOUND QUALITY:I always purchase Sennheiser Earphones or Headphones because I love the Clarity of Sound, and I'm happy with my purchase. The Vocals are very pure and clear, treble is great, bass is perfect for my preference and not to overpowering. Listening to all Genres of Music is enjoyable.MY FINAL VERDICT:If your looking for durable In-Ear-Canal phones for standard use on the go, please considered this, since even at an MRP of Rs.990.00 they are worth the money you put in for casual listening and I assure you, that you wont be disappointed with the quality of Sound!!I Hope My Review Will Help You,  Subscribe the Channel Backspace Pro.",One person found this helpful,0

Noise cancellation is also excellent, as it cancels out majority of external noise.Only downside is the wire is a flimsy. But even though it's been through some abuse there's not a scratch.

Despite careful usage the wires being so thin start getting cut within 6 months due to wear and tear.2. The wires are not tangle free. Sennheiser can use better quality tangle free wire just like in Boat earphones for which they may charge few Rupees extra.3. The warranty of 2 years does not cover the damage due to wear and tear or accidents which are the main reasons for discarding the earphones. Hence the 2 year warranty policy is more of a marketing gimmick with almost no practical application.4. No mic. Hence cannot be used for calls.

Up until these headphones I was mystified how anyone found in-ear headphones comfortable. I could never listen to anything for over 30-40 mins from such earphones. I realized I have earlobes which are probably on the smaller side and typical apple earpods or other earpods with rubber tips were just too big for my ear which caused the discomfort. It's not just that the tips of the pods are right size but the pods themselves are also on the smaller side and fit very snugly in the cave of the ear. They dont slide out even when your head is on pillow or a headrest. The sound quality is unbeatable for the price. The product fits well for people with following requirements:1) Not too pricey but pretty decent quality.2) Good fit for smaller earlobes/ears.3) Travel friendly as you dont need special cases. Its a standard earphone. Just grab, fold, dump and go. Although I havent faced any problem so far but the wires seem a little less durable. For longer vacations I use over the phones that are a lot more comfortable and have better noise cancellation.4) This is important - THERE IS NO MIC. So if you are ok using phone speaker while taking calls, you are peach. My calls typically last a max of 3-5 mins",,0

You can't just throw 'em around.~ Comfort - They are quite comfortable. They don't have that 45° thing fitting tho.~ Sound - This is what makes these earphones worth it. Awesome sound. Good bass. I don't know why, but at really low volumes I can hear some disturbance, which can be easily ignored actually.Final Verdict - Go for it if you aren't careless about stuff. Satisfying listening experience otherwise.P.S. - No Mic. Not a fuss really.",,0

Today I am here to tell you about my experience with Sennheiser Service. I brought the product about 11 months ago on Oct'18, but recently I faced issues regarding the headset. The right side earpiece sound dramatically goes low & I decided to claim Service request from Sennheiser. I am from Assam & there is no service centre near my location & actually all over India there is only 4 Service Centre available. The closest one is in Kolkata so I decided to call Sennheiser Service toll free no. & discuss about the matter. They told me not to send the headset to Kolkata Office as they do not have Courier facility to send the product back to you after repairing. They told me to send the product to Haryana office (Gurugram) with the box and all original accessories and Original Invoice. They also told me to write down my informations such as name, ph no, email id, & address in a paper & send it inside the box. I send the package & it took me just 8 days to get my product back from them & guess what I recieved a brand new Sennheiser CX180 headset. It put a nice smile on my face. I am very impressed with the Sennheiser Service, I recommend to go for their products & as everyone knows they are king in audio device making all over the world.

But it is very good for my usage so I just ordered another today.Your use case and design preferences may vary from mine so this review may not be relevant for you.Most important con: Microphone not available!But if you can live without that I can say nothing comes closer to perfect sound quality at this price point of 700 Rupees.Build quality is not that good.You do not get braided cables so forget about that spring like connector protection as well. What you get is very lightweight eartips (comfortable) with thin rubbery wires and a right angle connector (which I personally prefer). Yes you get extra eartips for all three sizes so it wont matter if you lost the default ones.If you do not take care of this earphone, it will not survive more than a year. Mine lasted 2 years and a month with average usage.The bass of this earphone is good enough (personal opinion of course).It is not excessive like some other brands that claim having Extra Bass or Deep Bass. So you get an optimal sound experience.And yes please stay away from this if you like Boomy Bass. You can buy those cheap local earphones that blow away your ears because this one will not do that.Overall, this comes very close to what sennheiser tries to do that is pure sound experience. Butat this price point this earphone will not feel like a true sennheiser product. Sennheiser's actual sound tuning and experience is for audiophiles and cost very much. But anyways I will always go for this product since my budget is tight.",,0

My average daily music consume is more than 6 hours. I don't have much knowledge about audio but trust me switching to Sennheiser CX 275 S was a great experience. The sound is great and feels clear. I am comparing it with Sony.- Sony. The base is high, a good choice.. Not so durable almost lost all earphones after 1 year. They work fine until the warranty is valid. Although the build is tangle free and feels sturdy.- Sennheiser. This was a surprise. The base is there as needed. Sound balance is top-notch. I became a big fan.. Best choice under 1.5K. The mic is good quality and the person on the other side gets a loud and clear sound.. This is better than CX 180. I am happy to pay almost 800 RS extra for better sound and mic experience.. Comes with 2 years warranty. This is just wow. I have friends who got it replaced and got a brand new even in there last month of warranty.Advice:If your budget is less then 3K. Close your eyes buy this. Even in 2020, this is the best option. Don't buy TWS or Bluetooths once they are just show off and sounds crap.If you don't have a 3.5mm hole in the phone then the other best option can be oppo Enco M31 under 3K. But trust me guys if you have that option to use wired once this is what you need. Hope to found this helpful. :)",,0

If you like to listen to lyrical of the songs more clearly then I would say this is right choice but if you like your songs on high volume then better opt for sony as they have bass enable good product but their downside is warranty tenure so keeping other factors in mind make the right choice.,,0

After approximately 6 months of use, here's what I observed.PROS1. Sound quality is really good. Covers frequency ranging from 10 hz. to 15,000 hz. Means, excellent bass, and remarkable treble sounds.2. The mouthpiece, or the mic, is also really good. I have found that the clarity at the other end is pretty good even when I am riding a bike @60kmph, which brings me to another point3. I occasionally listen to songs on this earphone while riding bike, and I have to tell you, noise cancelation is phenomenal.4. Another good thing I noted about this piece is that, while you are on a call and you speak on the mic, the earpiece gives you a feedback of your voice. In other words, you can hear yourself speak on the earpiece, which I found to be an interesting quirk. Reason being, in most of the noise cancelation earphones, you can't hear your voice, except for a deep rumbling on your chest (try speaking with your fingers plugging your ears)CONS1. Well, the wire noise is a bit turn off. Could have been better, but it is not too much to complain about anyway.2. Now this one really gets me. The left and right earpieces are reverse! From a brand like Sennheiser, this simply is negligence. Now, this doesn't make much of difference to someone who does not really care about where the sound is coming from, but for music lover like myself, this is a bummer. Your favorite song does not sound, well, like it should.But then, you can always switch your ears... Put left on right and right on left. That fixes everything, and there is no discomfort in your ears if you do so.But still...Anyway, a 4 star from my side.

But it also means I've used these for over 1.5 years now so it's really a long term use review.Without getting into technical details, they sound great. Sennheiser's earphones are known for being higher on treble and low on bass and these are no different. However, they produce good, strong, clear sound without any tearing and are capable of excellent surround effects with binaural sounds. They also have a great frequency response so you can hear the lows and the highs with equal clarity. I've primarily used these to watch Movies and TV Shows, ocassionally for Gaming and Music and I experienced superior audio in all cases (including 5.1 sound)The best part about Sennheiser though is its service. The earphones stopped working for me after 1.5 years. I took it to Sennheiser's service center. They asked for my contact details, explained the possible reason for the malfunction (apparently, I put too much strain on the connector causing it to internally break leading to audio issues) and promptly replaced it with a new one. That's it. No questions asked, as simple as that.So after a year and a half of use, I still have a brand new pair. Awesome.I do have to say though that the build quality isn't the best so these can last long if you take good care of them (the way you store them, the way you unplug them, etc.). I imagine most people don't which leads to defects. Also, these don't have a microphone built in in case that's a deal-breaker for you.Verdict? If you're someone looking for a pair of earphones under ₹1,000 that will last long and give you peace of mind, buy this without a doubt. The sound quality is pretty good and Sennheiser's warranty will ensure that you can use it for 2 years without any worries.",,0

Lakshman Iyer,1.0 out of 5 stars,IMPORTANT! READ BEFORE PURCHASING! CX275s,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R36OQEVMJVC2T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D75AB6I,Reviewed in India on 19 October 2020,Style name: CX 275s,https://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-CX-180-Street-II/product-reviews/B008V6T1IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_fmt?ie=UTF8&formatType=current_format,Verified Purchase,"So the CX 275s has an inherent fault. It does not have a ""L"" shaped adapter/connector for the jack. I did not know this as Amazon puts both cx 180 and cx275s product images together in its App.Now when i tried to connect the earphones, it keeps coming out of the socket of phone as the adapter is loose. So this means that whenever you move your phone or get up from ur seat, that little movement will pull the adapter out of the phone.Now I think Sennheiser realized this mistake and they have put a usb adapter 3.5mm to 3.5mm? This helps but ONLY if the phone is off its case. Thats right! you have to use the convertor and that too with ur phone case off. What a shame!",,0

I damaged my 1st earphone then bought the 2nd which lasted exactly 2yrs then i bought this same earphone 3rd time... It has been like a companion to me..I have listened to other branded ear phones in this range they are good until the moment you compare the music quality with CX-180. You will feel all those are good but not the best.The earphone wires looks very thin & sensitive but are actually very strong. While travelling i used to keep in my jeans pocket & some times slept on it but still it didn't get damage.With 2 years warranty you can get easy replacement if the earphone stop working with no physical damage.,,0

A solid 6/10.,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RTFBEDVU3MEUZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D75AB6I,Reviewed in India on 25 January 2020,Style name: CX 180,https://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-CX-180-Street-II/product-reviews/B00D75AB6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_fmt?ie=UTF8&formatType=current_format,Verified Purchase,"2020 Update.After delaying this purchase for weeks, I finally went ahead and bought these set of earphones. I was on a tight budget and desperately needed a new pair of earphones but I managed to hold off buying them for a few months and researched as much as I could.I have to admit my disappointment is through the roof.Let's break this down.I was previously using the JBL C100SI and then the Sony MDR - EX150AP. Somewhere in the middle, I also pushed myself to purchase some cheap ones and finally these.1) Overall purchase: 8/10- Shipped on time, convenient delivery and easy navigation on the website.- Great packaging.2) Build: 7/10- Not the most attractive but definitely not disappointing.- Thin wires. High chances of getting tangled.- Comfortable buds, sets inside the ears perfectly. Little to no pain whatsoever. Don't slide off and can be used over long periods of time.- L shaped jack. Low chances of internal wire damage.- No mic, but I was well aware of that before buying as I did not want a mic anyway.3) Sound: 4/10- The mids and highs are alright, nothing too crazy.- Obnoxious treble and a very cheap bass. The bass is almost non existent, actually. So much so, that the earphones they sell on the street for 120 bucks have at least a somewhat smooth sound. Yeah. That bad. I'm talking excruciating banging in your ears and reducing the volume to 60% in order to not lose your hearing. Maybe it's because I'm a psychopath who needs the volume at 100% at all times and you're actually supposed to listen to music at 60-70% in order to experience good bass and overall sound, but hey, it is what it is. If you listen to your music with volume at 100% and expect smooth bass and not a shrill sound that pierces your eardrums, these are so not for you. All the earphones (including the cheap ones) I mentioned above don't do that. Shocking.- Sound/volume distorts above 80% volume. It's painful, it is.- The noise cancellation is pretty great but honestly, not at the cost of your eardrums.Overall: 6/10. And I'm being generous here. No offence.I don't care so much about the build, design, company or even the shipping/delivery if the sound itself is so... excuse my French... bad.I'm gonna be honest here. I don't like to bootlick famous brands or even run after branded things, but I genuinely did not expect this from such a renowned brand. Sennheiser and disappointment are two words I never thought I'd use in the same sentence, but here we are.All in all: The earphones aren't all that bad if you keep your volume at 70% while listening to music and at 85% while watching movies, etc. If you handle them carefully, they will last you a long time and the customer service is brilliant. I'm just surprised that Sennheiser created these. I wouldn't believe you if you told me.And before anyone comes at me, yes the ones I received were genuine and not a fake reproduction.I'm looking forward to less disappointing purchases from Sennheiser in the near future.TL;DR: If you're a bass lover and lisen to music with your volume all the way at 100%, these are definitely not for you. Otherwise, they're alright. Not Sennheiser's best.- A disappointed customer.",,0

Got it within 24 hrs. At night it was ordered and got the shipment next morning. Product was also 100% genuine. Sound quality and clarity is very good and soothing as well. In ear feel is very comfortable as it is very light in weight. It fits very easily in the ear. Even it comes with 2 year warranty. Just seems a small drawback that the wire is very thin and with no microphone. Its very difficult to say about the durability & whether it could be able to withstand the regular wear or tear or not. Maybe other people can say it who are using it quite for a long time. But nowadays all earphones wire is thin in nature. Only some Bluetooth earphone comes with very good quality wire but the price is also very high for that and may be out of the budget for most of the people. But in this price range it is one of the best in my opinion. Hope this much info will help the next willing customer to decide whether to buy this product or not. I've ordered another one & just waiting to get it with an expectation to get the genuine product this time as well. I hope the seller will keep the commitment this time as well and not disappoint me and not let me give any chance to return it back.,One person found this helpful,0

Best sounding earphones at this range and even better than most other which are more expensive than these. I have tried others so I am talking with experience. Sound is very clear and crisp highs and lows are very clear mids are better than expected and bass is very functional it comes when it's needed no unnecessary booming can be heard. Wires are pretty weak but not cheap looking or even the material is not cheap as it can be seen over time. If kept properly can easily be used for a long time. I personally bought it because of the sound quality. I would say this is the best close to audiophile experience u can get at such a low cost.

They sound great but they don't sound that overwhelming has I was expecting after watching the reviews. Yes sound speration is good though but sometime bass over power. To get best of this earphones you have to burn in the speaker. For burn in you can play the sound from youtube and keep it over night running for burn in and then they come alive. Yes they have good bass low and mids are balance. As I am coming from RHA MA390u and RHAs500u and Sound magic E10c. If you have budget of 2000 I will suggest you to go for RHA MA390U THEY SOUND AMAZING as compared to this. I bought it for 1499 but under the budget of 1500 and considering the price of 1500 they sound amazing for it.Talking about the build Quality to be honest I am not that impressed with the build quality they should have provid braided cable I don't think so that rubber coating of the cable will survive that well.

This product rendered really good quality of sound at first but with time, the quality dropped drastically. Senheiser is known for catching the subtle distinctions of each frequency perfectly at a time and giving a harmonious experience while listening. But after the regular use of only four and half months, this very specific characteristic is lost. I made sure that no damage has been caused to the earphone (even though its tangled chord often gives a tough time to handle) due to any mishandling or rough uses. Now a days, the product puts forth almost a monophonic sound. The bass was never really high. And it's ok since I already knew about its bass quality during my purchase. Noise cancelation is up to the modest mark, more or less. But as I stated earlier, the quality dropped for no reason what so ever. I didn't buy an earphone worth double a thousand bucks just to last only for four months. So, I am quite unhappy with this particular product.",,0

Best sounding earphones I ever used. Sennheiser is god in term of clarity in the audio.People these days are talking about bass all the time and giving uncomfortable muddy bassy sounding earphones 5 stars. Don't know what happened to people nowadays. They are excessively bassy all the time which is not at all good for long time usage and headache inducing. Also the bass comes by sacrificing the overall clarity, instrument separation and good overall sound. Which is an absolutely no no for me.  Sennheiser cx180 does have bass when needed, and very sufficiently so. It just comes and goes like magic.I have previously used Sennheiser MX 170, a long ago in my teenage which just surprised me that this audio quality is also reality. Though they don't have rubber buds and very uncomfortable for me, so I switched to senneheiser cx180. After that I used Sennheiser cx213 which was also very good but I preferred cx180. After that I used a lot of other brands' earphones, like :Boat (totally uncomfortable and overall bad sound quality),JBL c100si and c150si (both same. good but not as much as this one, cx180 has much more clearer sound. Also Jbls have more bulk than cx180),Realme buds (good enough for bassy music overall, but muddy mid and treble. comfortable enough),Audio Technica clr100 (good clarity, though not as clear as cx180 but lacks bass very much which cx180 doesn't) etc. Then I came back to cx180 again. Because it is true love. I cannot praise it enough.This earphone sounds like heaven to me. The clarity and richness of the sound is incomparable in this price point. They are so lightweight, small and comfortable that I don't even realize that I'm wearing them.Yes just like all the good things come at a cost, it also has a con, which is it doesn't have a mic. Very big bummer to a totally perfect earphone. But I don't mind the sound quality makes up for it for me. I use jbl for phone calls :vIf sound quality is your priority, just get it already and you will know what I'm talking about. 🤘",,0

It is best in sound quality in this price and i am enjoying to use this for daily use .the only problems that the company want to look at is the skin of earphone. It is of rubber and it easily gets fade away after use. After the use of 5 months its skin starts getting removed and it is necessary to add some skin to that earphone because it become difficult to use after skin starts to fade away because there is the chances that the earphone may stop working and company doesn't give warranty on physical damage . so only advice is to purchase the skin for earphone. Otherwise it is best for daily use,,0

But in terms of design I think1. The cable feels a bit delicate.2. The cable at the point of connection with speaker also feels delicate, which makes it compulsory to pull the earpiece with our hands rather than pulling it out with wire.3. This is important thing that, I haven't noticed anywhere about left and right earpiece. We can figure it out quickly by doing a left right sound test but it would have been a good design if it was included on earpiece.I have bought it for my OnePlus 6t and it works great, only require to use less than half sound in my home.Overall I feel like it's awesome should have to maintain it carefully and using full sound is not recommended but without using full sound one can't feel that super good bass effect.

Material quality is really good, just make sure you dont twist the section of the wire which can result in complete rip off.

But if you like music and vocals with almost all minute details go for it. The only thing I didn't like about it is its not durable. They are delicate to use. I've used them for three years and then wear and tear started though I used them with most care. Then one day sound from left side stopped. I did buy it earlier and ordered again today. Waiting for them to arrive. For best experience wait for it's burn period to be over before returning it.,,1

Its cable is so thin that it may break anytime. Also there is tangling problem in cable much more than usual earphones. Its headphone jack doesn't fit every mobile device correctly and stop working within 3-4 months for sure. Other than that, one side of earphones will stop working in 3-4 months. Mic quality is very nice, I've used it for recording videos also. These earphones are only great because of their warranty period of two years, so you can exchange them anytime even via courier.",,0

This is literally the best product you can get in this range if your priority is music quality above all. I am personally using this product for about 3 years now and this had been the best companion of mine since then, may it be long traveling or just chilling on your bed. I love this product due to several reasons and I would like to state some of them.- I particularly like the balance between the bass and tremble that this product maintains as it offers crisp music quality and brings out the minute details off the song.therefore it doesn't matter if you listen to nucleya or kishore kumar!!. You'll get the best out of both. So it's a 10 on 10 for music quality.- It's perfect for any ears as it fits in smoothly and gives an immerse listening experience for a long period of time. I used it many time for my 6-7 hours long traveling so I strongly recommend for people who travel more and ones who like to sleep while listening to music.- One of the most important factor that generally people don't see while they purchase earphones is customer service and warranty. This earphones comes with 2 years warranty. After using it for about one and a half year suddenly my right earpiece stopped working , I sent it to my nearest service centre and within 20 days I got brand new ones. Really cool right!!- I must tell you that this provides decent noise cancellation, for the price I think it's great. Also it's not bass heavy so if you are strictly into EDM you might not like it. But if you're flexible with music and like to listen to wide range of music genres this earphones are definitely the one for you guys.- One of the major disadvantages that this earphone has is that it doesn't have microphone so if you talk a lot over the phone simply DON'T buy these. Tangleness is not much of an issue. Other than this These earphones are the best you can get.I hope you will find this review usefull :)",,0

For those saying that these lacks bass, it doesn't at all in my opinion. Rather, it's good in that aspect instead of bass being all over the place like many extra bass earphones that are available at this price. These pair of headphones should be given some time to burn it after purchase. Noise cancelling is really good and ear plugs are very comfortable for long duration. However, it needs to be mentioned that these have a delicate build and feel, and looks cheap considering other products at this price, most of which have a much better build. Wires are thin and prone to tangle. Not recommend for rough use. But as far as quality of sound goes, it's one of the best if not the best at this range of price(1-2k). Great product(except build quality) at this price and the 2 year warranty that comes with it makes it more so.",,0

If it's under the warranty guidelines they will straight away replace it with the new one, no bitching and excuses. My brother had a JBL earphone what they did is made excuses that the problem was due to torn wires and refused to replace.So don't take that warranty for granted. This is the first time I have spend 800 for a headphone used it for more than 2 years without looking for another one. It really is worth your wallet.",,0

So i am well qualified to review these earphones.Talking of any earphones I feel there will be 4 characteristics that are to be discussed to make a decision whether to go for them or not. So here we go:1) sound quality: Hailing from a reputed brand these earphones deliver amazing sound. I have used a lot of earphones but none can match these. I can say these are the best wired earphones in a budget of <3k. Yes, I personally felt even the overpriced earphones from Sony or jbl cant match these earphones in any aspect.2) Design & build quality: These earphones have a minimalistic design. They are very light in weight and the material used looks like plastic but is of very high quality. The cable is of very good quality and flexible.Believe me I have used these earphones for more than 2 years now and they still look like new ones.3) Durability: As I said they are made of high quality material and must easily give a life of more than 2 years.(even the warranty period is 2 yrs).4) pricing: Coming to pricing I will have to choose some of competitors to evaluate its value. As of now we have boat, Sony, jbl and skull candy as it's competitors with a couple of their products priced in and around 500-2k INR.I have used all of these brands and I personally feel they are no where in competition with senheisser. I have used boat rockerz(<649INR), they felt good initially but are not durable like these. Coming to skull candy, they have a good bass but the quality of the earphones is not so good, many people including me have faced a problem where one of the earplugs stopped working within 6 months. Coming to jbl and Sony , though these are reputed brands I just feel their products are overpriced. Senheisser being a reputed brand too, has delivered a best in class product here, with a killer pricing of under 899INR. I actually bought them for 699. You can get them at lower prices during any sale.**The only thing I felt missing in these earphones is a mic. Yes, if you are looking for earphones that allow taking calls, this is not the one for you.**Judgement: If you are looking for best in class earphones under 1.5k, without a mic and provided you are not a die hard fan of jbl or Sony , just go with these earphones blindfolded.",,0

I brought it and I wasn't satisfied with the sound quality.  Within 6 months those earphones lost their life. It's not even broken but it's not working.So, back to basics!

I will give my reasons as below.Dont get me wrong, these earphones are good but they have their pro and cons. I am really happy with the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd and their delivery was very prompt, highly appreciate their service.So, firstly if talk we about pros these earphones build quality is good, won't tangle that easily even if they are tangled we can untangle them easily which is certainly a good thing in my opinion and they are very light weight you can use them for any longer hours, you won't feel uncomfortable atall. Secondly we talk about the sound out put its better than any earphone in this price range, people who like bass always throughout the song and movie scenes, they will really enjoy it and they might find best for them, because these pair of headphones are bass driven,so do these, treble is also good and mids are also so clear, they are very soothing to ears.but am not okay with the extended bass reason i will mention in the cons section.finlal pro would about the warranty these earphones hold 2 years warranty which is never heard in this price point.So, the con or negative aspect of these earphones is as they produce bass continuesly even when it is not required, may be some find its good to have extra bass. But actually speaking the extra base effect in these earphones will kills the fine details in sound overall it won't be a good experience in watching movies, but for listening music i think it won't be a issue. Still sound is very subjective my opinion might not match with yours. And at full volume sound becomes too loud and again details are lost so recommend you not to listen at hing volume.These are my thoughts on these earphones.point to be noted in order to use the full potential of these ear phones we need a good quality headphone jack device.",,0

I bought Sennheiser cx275s now. I'm really disappointed with this. Low bass and lack of qualiy on treble as well. There is not even a L/R indicator. I've requested for a return already. I can still suggest boAt 220/225 strongly. It has excellent sound quality with super extra bass and tangle free cable with decent microphone as well. And most importantly, boAt costs around 600rs only while cx275s comes around 2k. Go for boAt either 220/225.",,0

I've had them for 14 months now and i must say that this pair, given the price at which they come, is one of the best (if not the best) pair of headphones currently being offered with great sound and exceptional durability (which is quite amazing considering their flimsy build). They are not bass heavy, and give off an all-round rich sound with superb clarity. I find them to be way better than the JBL C100SI. Ever since my purchase, I've used them almost daily for 5-6 hours and haven't spotted a problem (yet). They've been tugged, stretched and bent in every way possible and they still survive, miraculously, to this day. If you're looking for great sound quality and are willing to compromise on seemingly weak built quality, then, without a doubt, go for them.",,0

After two years the earphones finally started showing some problems for the first time after two years. Sometimes the vocal gets lost and it plays only the music. I have to manually press the headphone jack tightly again to regain the vocals. I knew this kind of problem is gonna happen some time when I bought this because no product is ever lasting. But I am genuinely surprised to have this working for the past two years without any issues because I am particularly not too gentle with the earphones. Can't the say the sound quality that you get is the absolute best but can definitely say its the absolute best for the price that you pay. The product has been part of my life for the last two years, I feel bad for replacing it now. The only con that I have faced is the absence of a mic, but I got used to that eventually. If you are with a budget of Rs 800 and in a dilemma to choose which earphone, just blindly go for this. You can't go wrong with this one.",,0

These earphones are very light, ergonomic and fashionable. Their cable is very thin but strong enough to resist normal wear and tear easily. The build quality is decent. Overall, the durability is good at the price tag they come with.Coming to how these sound, perhaps these are the loudest earphones under 1k. They have a high sensitivity of 110db/mw which is higher than any earphone at this price. These pack some tight and punchy bass (mostly upper and musical bass). Sub bass is not promising but you cannot expect an earphone to have everything at this price. Mids are present and at par with what any other earphone has to offer under 1k. Vocals sound very natural and boasts of a great deal of clarity. The highs are very sparkling and crisp but however at loud volumes, they can get a little soaring and distorted (usually after 90% volume). At higher volumes, the lows are dominated by highs which is necessary to ensure they sound detailed and clear. Overall they have a good close to the original sound reproduction except the distortion at high volumes. Bass is not very heavy. Sound is very rich, detailed and crisp.These earphones are good for those who want to enjoy listening to a variety of genres due to a well balanced sound. But more balanced is the sound, lesser the fun it becomes to listen to any specific genre. They also have a good SOUNDSTAGE which is not too narrow but not so wide as well. Stereo sound is average.

Sound quality is not at all the problem with this headphone, but real problem is its jack design. I am travelling guy so i really needed ear phone to listen to music while i am travelling, but as soon as I put mobile in my pocket jack come little out and whatever i am listening sound comes from one side. I need to press jack to listen properly, if i don't do that then whole jack comes out and video or music i am listening gets paused. As this ear doesnt have any buttons, i need to take out phone put jack and play the music and put mobile in pocket, then hardly after walking two step again same thing happens.Now i am using this earphone only while i am not moving and while holding my phone in hand or to connect to laptop.

To be honest this headphones has the right amount of base. This is a must for music lovers. Durability is average (viewing my friend's headphones) the wire can be damaged with some force so joggers be careful. I wish Sennheiser would make braided models of these.2 years of warranty is a sweet spot. I'd recommend this headset over the JBL any day. Gaming experience was awesome.

One of the first concerns I had was if the product was fake; because a few other reviewers pointed to the same. As soon as I received the package, I went to the Sennheiser website to make sure that my product was genuine. It was, indeed. My primary concern allayed, I opened the package and I was very happy with everything. You get a 3.5mm adapter, extra ear buds, a pouch, and a manual. The earphones themselves are just fantastic, I tested them quite rigorously today and they held up very well. The bass is not extraordinary, but it's very good quite frankly speaking and unless you're an obsessive audiophile, you shouldn't be disappointed with the sound. The build quality is good, they don't feel cheap. I played a range of music, from your Bollywood numbers to trance to hip-hop to death metal to Djent even and found that the sound was quite good and enjoyable. At decent volumes, these earphones shut the world out and immerse you in the music completely. At the price, these earphones are a steal.

So consider reading the complete review.First the cons:1. Wire is a bit thin. But very smooth to handle.2. If not kept in a proper case, it'll take you few seconds to unwind.3. None other that I know of.Pro:1. Highly durable if you care enough for the things you use.2. The 2 years warranty is something. If you find the music is not as good as when it was new due to some issue in earbuds, return (courier or in person) it to the Sennheiser guys. Provided it is physically undamaged, they will hand you over a new one.3. Noise cancellation is optimum. Pedestrians must avoid using it if in heavy road traffic.4. Awesome music quality. You can actually distinguish between different frequencies and different instruments that has be used. Mid and high frequencies sounds crisp. Bass could have been better. Ofcourse you mustn't compare the quality with the ones you get with 3k-4k bucks.5. Use it for long hours, I mean really long time, still you won't find  anything uncomfortable with you ears. Can be used comfortably while you're sleeping in you bed.6.

I wanted to avoid the s***ty music being played in Gym so I bought these and I can say these are amazing and does the job at best even in a very loud and noisy backgroud of Gym.2. I really get annoyed of earpieces falling off the ear. I dont like over ear design because they are really uncomfortable if wore a long time over sweaty ears. Sennheiser CX 180 are very comfortable and sticks to you ear like a glue. I had no problem while jogging running or doing any other exercise.,,0

These earphones reproduce the old hifi standards without overshoots on bass and treble. It faithfully reproduces natural sound. The voice comes through very well . Bass is not overaching to the ear as is seen in most speaker systems of today. Treble is deep and pleasing to hear. Voice comes through well balanced. Overall at this price it is a marvel . Can easily rival many earphones costing many times over. Buy without hesitation.,,0

Harsh Vyas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Critical review after 1.7 year ( a true guide and comparison),https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R39P7Q2BIDRGJP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D75AB6I,Reviewed in India on 8 November 2018,Style name: CX 180,https://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-CX-180-Street-II/product-reviews/B00D75AB6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_fmt?ie=UTF8&formatType=current_format,Verified Purchase,"(nov,2018)If you prefer bass sound more than surely go for it.all over better than any other in its segment like sony and mi etc.more tone of trable is notified.Edited: (11sept, 2020)Build: lasted almost 1.2 year, then one stopped. Both stopped at 1.8 year.But i had used roughly in start for 6 months otherwise it would have lasted more properly. Thin wires are there, but externally looks delicate inside it's as strong as realme,jbl and sony.Sound quality: tried jbl c100si, boat basshead 225 and sony mdras210, and sony ex155ap,150ap. But compared to all these, Sennheiser sounded too better in balanced sound output. (Bass quality) Base is there, but bass is different thing as it has 20 hz lowest frequency not for typical bass lovers. But sony muffles the base and bass often with vocals and mids, these performes better.CONS: AT 100 percent volume as it is for balanced sound it happened to throw more treble which no-one will like. But if u have equilizer in your device then not at all to worry (i dnt have that's why it caused problem). But must to mention that it doesn't distort still at full volume.At lowest volume even the performance is heavenly. Every boat that i tried happened to throw so much irritating bass even in vocals and happened to change every music instrument sound because of too bass focused. So dnt buy boat at all. ( But if you don't knw and understand sound signature and cannot differentiate between good and bad then buy boat , because boat has 4.3 rating which is given by typical Indian music lovers who doesn't understand the quality and what is bass. They just want cheap bass)If your budget is high for 1500 i suggest to try sony xb55 or xb55ap because it has bass with balanced sound.Price: i bought this at 550 so it's too worthy believe me. Don't even buy 1000 rupees handset it's better than all except xb55 sony.Now i purchased it again today at 729. This model is stopped by company and has launched cx213 which is available at flipkart. (Don't buy tht, because in build quality cx180 is better)Amazon should not hype price of model which is not manufactured by company any more, only because it's only available here. But still this price is worthy to givr for cx180.One thing to remember it doesn't have mic, but still i re purchased it only because without mic handset is durable than with mic handset. If mic is necessary than go for another Sennheiser handsfree , otherwise it's good.So take care of what u need.Comfort: it's too comfortable. U will forget it is anything there in ears. So it's best. It has L shaped jack which is nice compared to other competitors. (L shaped jack is muct in today's time). Also it doesn't have angled eartip so if by accident u strech it, it will not break and will just fall from ears, so it's one of the pros.Before coming to comparison one important thing is it has 2 years warranty better, but anyway as u can see in my latest images rupper coating of joint and downside the earbuds teared off in one year only and they don't claim warranty for physically damaged piece. But if u care properly then ok. But not at all this rupper coating will last for 2 years (in dream , no matter how u care). But i must mention if your handset is not damaged physically I ve heard that after sale service is excellent as u would expect from premium brand. But not buy only because it has two year warranty it's of no use.Along with that no matter which wired handset u buy of 500 or 2000. It will last maximum 1.5 or 1 year, be it sony or boat. In rare cases I've seen some lasting for 2 years and even more.Comparison:Boat basshead 225: i returned that just before the day after trying it, too much bass. Doesn't deliver quality sound at all. Only typical bass lovers of india may like this irritating bass. (Similar to ubon handsfree of 150 rupees)Jbl c100si: I've listened songs in that so many times. It's better in bass compared to cx180. But cannot produce premium balanced sound. But it has mic so one plus point. Mine lasted for 1.2 years.They don't reveal driver size or frequency, so i don't like it.Sony ex155/ex150:Better in bass, but can handle mids and vocals better than jbl c100si.good byt price is over hyped wait for sale.Realmebuds 2:I had purchased when my right earbud stopped working but returned at the same time. Build quality impressive but anyway major downside like jbl , doesn't have L shaped jack. Even not gold plated. Otherwise overall good. For mixture of everything  mids , vocals and highs. It sounded well than what i had expected.Overall ratings : out of 10Build:Cx180- 8Jbl c100si and other models- 8.5Boat basshead 225/220 (both are same don't confuse): 9Sony ex155/150: 7.5Realme: 9.5(Don't know reality tasted review)Sound:Cx180- 9.5C100si jbl-8.5Sony ex155/150-9Realme-8.3Boat basshead 225-6After sale service:Jbl-8Boat-8Sony-9Realme-8Sennheiser:9.5Surround sound output:Jbl:8Sony:9.5Cx180:9Boat:5 (played pubg to notice surround by listening to foot steps of enemy , when enemy came in front me till then i could not decide from where ge is coming-lol)Sort guide:For bass jbl c100si or ex155. If budget is 1500 must buy xb55 sony (wait for sale , don't buy for 2000 not tht much worthy)For balanced sound but cx180 only. If mic is needed then go for jbl and then sony.Overall performance and features wise realme buds2 is better. As it has mic  but not so premium sound.If mic and too heavy bass is not priority then cx180 is the best as conclusion.",,0

Tinny sound, slightly muffled but somewhat comfortable would be the right words to describe these(they are kinda comfortable). Heck, even some in-the-box earphones are better than these. They somehow manage to merge two different instruments in the background and clearly have a lacking soundstage. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.PS: These could actually be just a defective piece and I have applied for a refund. If the new piece is actually as good as some other reviews make them seem, I will update this review accordingly.",,1

The seller Cloudtail delivered it timely. I researched a lot about earphones before buying and fixed onto this. The Sony earphones with extra bass are quite expensive, the Skullcandy ones do not last long and so  Sennheiser being a reputed brand I took this. This is the best-selling earphone under Rs. 1000. I will now discuss what I liked about this:1. Sound quality - First and foremost, the sound quality is amazing. It’s very crisp and bass is ok too. The highs and mids are clear and can hear every beat. With proper equalizer this can be a beast. Anyways, the lows can be managed as they can’t be crystal clear on an expensive one too.2.Comfort - The earphone looks to be durable and last for a long time. Yes, the wire is thin but coming from a well established brand it will not wear easily.3. Packaging - The box was well packed and you will find the earphones along with changeable earbuds. The box may not be as stylish like that of the Sony ones but quite decently it is packed.4. Price - Under Rs. 1000 it’s a deal because you get a complete package with good branded earphones and crisp sound that will shake your soul. If you are bass-head then you can go for Sony MDR-XB30EX else this one’s perfect for you. Overall, I am loving music on this earphone and been over 6 months with no issues.Very fine reactive customer care",,0

This is my second Sennheiser earphones.. The sound quality that they are giving at this price point is great 👍..Bass is alright.. Vocals at some point are kinda clumsy at high volumes sometimes... This can be avoided by listening to moderate sound.. The thing is this guy is loudest!.. You can't find something at this price point..But.. Material quality is not good.. believe me guys..if you gonna use this as a daily driver.. You are gonna last with these like 1 year..(My last one did last 1.3 years..I guess)..Final Verdict...- Bass ✓- treble ✓ ( don't go high on volume..you  mightt damage the ear)- Vocals ✓ ( kinda perfect)- build quality 👎 ( Not the best)- durability ( depends on how u use)My suggestion.. Go with case or pouch..If you go rough.. They end up 6 or 8 monthsIf you go moderate..they end up 1.3 or 1.5 years,,0

You may create extra BASS by changing audio's internal setting but it will lower the sound clarity.Look and Feel (4.5/5): Looks simple and beautiful and is very comfortable to ears. It seems delicate but I think it is durable because one night I slept keeping them in ears and nothing had happened to any of its speakers.Problem: It tangles often.

Over a period of using the headphone jack got loose I can't repair that know I got only option to throw the headphone.Suggestion: Don't buy headphones without Mic feature. If you buy without mic over period the jack won't sit properly inside jack socket and you will start facing loose connection even though you have inserted headphone jack properly to the Mobile/Laptop jack socket.,,0

The passive noice cancellation is just amazing and work so good if you are walking on the road you will hardly lisnt the vehicles sounds.

Then get this. Not for extra bass lovers. The fit is a little bit tricky to insert as well because of the unconventional shape of the headsets. But what matters is the sound quality, The latency is almost non existent on the microphone button, atleast on my phone anyway. No microphonics at all during normal usage and during walking. This is probably the only headset where i did not rely on the music player inbuilt equaliser to modify the sound signature. That speaks about the sound reproduction on the Sennheiser headsets.",One person found this helpful,0

The build quality seems to be flimsy, but am sure the 2 years warranty will take care of that. Could have also added volume controls with mic and remote button for taking calls.",,0

The Beats and music detail are so clear that even at lowest volume you can feel every single beat.The Headset fitting in ears is awesome. You can listen to the songs for hours without hurting your ears.The Noise reduction is perfect as even at low volumes you can experience all the fun.TheBut be cautious as it is not for persons who love Boombox type music.

The treble sound gave me headache, but though it worked really good for some of my friends. This one, as other satisfied customers explained, goes well with bass.

Came across these CX 180 again and at an attractive price of 619 rs. Immediately ordered them. They are great for that price.Hell, they are very good gor even a 1000 bucks. No earphone comes close to the bass and the clarity of sound these have. They sound better than even a 2000 rs skullcandy.

Not that it is very loud in a uncomfortable way.the fit is perfect hence noise isolation is very goood.not recommended while riding.overall this is the best earphone in this range with a very very good sound quality.

The sound quality it gives is very good, i should say outstanding but without a proper pin fitting theres no charm. i hope you can look into this and resolve it.",,0

It may not produce best bass but it is good at the price at which it comes. Sennheiser is all about clarity. I've been using the product for about one year, it works fine. The only problem is its durability. Using this headphone daily on an average basis, you may find over an year that the wear and tear of the piece is way beyond normal. The build quality could be better. except that it is great headphone to have at this price range. I would also recommend this headphone over any other headset because as i said earlier sennheiser is all about clarity. As now a days the smartphones can be equipped with various media players so i think bass would not be a problem at all.",,0

But jbl t150 a gives almost same quality at considerably lower price (this one is slightly better though). So if u are looking for value for money go for jbl t150a (available at 899 when I ordered this ) or else this is fabulous.. Specially the ear buds are super comfortable (much more comfortable than jbl ones). The wire is a little thin but sturdy. The material looks a bit sticky. Better keep it carefully if you don't plan  use  it for a long time. (one of my older Nokia headset suffered from that. Got tangled and rubber melted and ultimately unusable).But in short if you are looking for a good earphone with mic in mid range budget this is a solid option.,,0

The boosted lows will scare away purists, and even bass fiends might find the highs, which are boosted and tweaked in peculiar spots, occasionally tinny or harsh. An inline remote control and microphone add value to the CX 275s, but the remote lacks volume controls, which is a bit of a bummer. Overall, the CX 275s is a powerful pair with a lot to love,Pros - Powerful, distortion-free audio performance with deep, boosted lows. Inline remote control and microphone for mobile devices. Comfortable, secure, lightweight fit.Cons - Inline remote has no volume controls.",,0

I bought these and must say I love it. Occasionally there are some minor issues with the volume when it increases all of a sudden marginally, nevertheless still love it. There is mic also which makes taking calls easier, however no volume buttons . You have to use the phone to reduce/increase the volume.

That was my first hand experience I loved the way it handled my workout playlist which mainly contains heavy metal, electronic and rock music. I liked the noise isolation and the bass.I experimented them later with different music genres and came up with the conclusion that if you are just looking for something decent under a grand then these are for you. But nothing top of the charts though. Seriously!Edit-So it's been more than a year and half. The 3.5mm jack is not working anymore giving me weird noise chopping off certain bass notes entirely. Maybe it's because of my rough usage but I would have liked this one really well it it had lasted longer.

I wish they could have controlled the treble and lows more. Sometimes it feels very loud though I was able to control that by help of equalizer. I am using this with my one plus one and its working good. Since I have started using it recently I can't comment on the durability but wire is very thin.

Unfortunately the left bud stopped functioning abruptly. So i wanted a replacement ASAP. I was going through the reviews of earphones that cost around 500 bucks and came across Sennheiser CX180. The reviews were so +ve that I couldn't find any match to this product. Also the fact that few people couldn't find a broad difference between native CX180 version and CX180 Street version made me pick the latter. I could tell you that this product is the best below 1000 bucks. The quality is quite good and this product won't disappoint you at all. Go for it if your budget is around 500-600. The main feature is the noise cancellation although the bass quality isn't upto the mark.,,0

It is very annoying and takes away from a good listening experience.I would recommend these ONLY if you are going to be stationary when using these or do not buy them",,0

You surely wouldn't want to listen with these at a very high sound level because it can damage your ears .Giving 4 stars for the price, sound quality(at normal level) & build. Deducting 1 for the cable quality(strictly thin, handle with care), beats at high sound levels(beats become somewhat rugged). Njoy!!!",,0

Nothing to say on the Cons section this time as I verify.I'd recommend this pair of earphones to anybody who appreciate real quality earphones to listen to music. And for the price of 600 bucks, It is a steal.",,0
